When you have to cancel a day of racing, itâ€™s usually a bad thing. But the @transcascadia crew turned what could have been a major disappointment into what was possibly the best day of the eventðŸ¤˜
Everyone loaded up with a log or 2, and maybe a beer or 2, and rode to the top of the ridgeline for a bonfire hang outðŸ”¥ before dropping in on the last sweet singletrack downhill runs back to camp to celebrate.
All in all, a great day out!
