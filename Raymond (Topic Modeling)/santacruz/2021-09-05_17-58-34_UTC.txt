A bit of a rough day at the track for the @scsyndicate in LenzerheideğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­
Greg was struggling early in the week with some lingering back issues, then had a race run where nothing went right for the new World Champ, eventually finishing P19. 
Luca has a mishap that launched him off the bike and onto his back in the rocks. Very thankfully it looks like no major injuries and he has a bit of time to heal up before the country roads take him home to the 2 race back-to-back season finale In Snowshoe, West Virginia ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸
We are writing this one off and already getting stoked for some North American World Cup action only 10 days awayğŸ‘Š
