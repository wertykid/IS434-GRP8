Five years ago @luca_shaw suited up in his first kit for The Syndicate, a school gym outfit for the infamous 2017 team launch video. And the good times rolled on from there.

Five race seasons later, Luca has pulled on dozens of @scsyndicate race kits, ridden thousands of miles, sprayed gallonsÂ of champagne, eaten mountains of @wafflehouseofficial and shared countless hugs and high-fives with his teammates, friends and fans. Syndicate University (#fiveyearplan) has taught him well, and now Luca is ready to roll on to what's next.

So 'tis the season to be jolly stoked about all the good times we've had together.
On behalf of Santa Cruz, the Syndicate and all our partners, we are wishing him the best of luck in his new ventures next season.

Luca, our pit is always open to ya' buddy... you know where we hide the key!ðŸ–¤
