Back to normal… Is what we thought 2021 would be.
Back to big group rides, back to after ride beers, back to big hugs and high-fives, back to seeing all our favorite bands, back to carefree international travel, back to a race season with no cancellations, back to having bike parts come in on boats and trucks without delay…Instead we got back-to-back years of mayhem.
But you know what? We made the most of it, and we are pretty damn stoked with all the good things that happened here in 2021💥
•
1. Danny doing Danny things. The year started off steep & sketchy as @danny_macaskill & his #5010CC took on the Dubh Slabs on the Isle of Skye. Insane⛰

2. The #htSQD win everything.
The Intro of our new US based XC team in May kind of flew under the radar, until they started scooping up all the top mens & womens results at every event they entered👊

3. The first @xgames #RealMTB saw not one, but two top Santa Cruz athletes in @veroniquesandler & @danny_macaskill✌️
•
4. The Union
@steelcitymedia pulls together the next generation of DH talent under one awning. We can’t wait to see where this goes @join.the.union 🙌

5. The launch of our new #Blur4 Superlight™️ model & accompanying film #AllezMaxime!🥖

6. The new Bronson gets a haircut #BronsonMX
#businessinthefrontpartyintheback✂️

7. @benhildred rides 1 million vertical feet in 200 days. Read that again and let it sink in. This man is unreal🤯

8. Greg fucking Minnaar.
Greg captures his 4th World Championship title, his 11th World Champs medal, and the hearts of every 40yr old athlete who thinks ‘they still have it’ Cheers @gregminnaar🍾🐐
•
9. The New Chameleon. We launched the 8th edition of our Chameleon model with 5 stories from 5 different riders with 5 different builds & intended uses🖐

We’ll see you all in 2022.
Happy New Year!
