Arrival of the Fittest
•
Santa Cruz never went to cross country school. If we had, the report card would have read like a masterclass in delinquency: “Uses 120mm travel for 24 hour events.” “Races hardtails with 140mm forks.” “Charges uphill on 160mm gravity bikes.”
We’ve been sat at the back of the class all our lives…But it doesn't mean we haven't been paying attention.
