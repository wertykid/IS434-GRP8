Worlds qualifying doesnâ€™t mean a whole lot, as there are no points or changes in the start order, but that doesnâ€™t completely stop the @scsyndicate guys from giving it a proper go in Lenzerheide with @lorisvergier ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·qualifying with the 2nd fastest time, @luca_shaw ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ 7th, and @gregminnaar ğŸ‡¿ğŸ‡¦ 30th.
Bring on the finals!
