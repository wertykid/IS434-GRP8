The New Bronson

Why’d we mix it up?
If you value style at speed or want to have fun feeling fast, then mixed wheels - 29” up front, 27.5” out back - are a great way to get there.
The larger front wheel provides more traction and stability that will make you feel more confident squaring off the turns and diving for the inside lines. But a 27.5-inch tire in the rear means this bike still loves getting up on the back wheel and into the air.

So basically, the mixed wheel setup retains the Bronson's whippable character but the gives the bike added traction and stability for hard hitting riding.
