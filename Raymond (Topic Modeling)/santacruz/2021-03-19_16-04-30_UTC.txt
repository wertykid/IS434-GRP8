Great edit from Alexis Skarda’s 100 mile FKT chasing run at The White Rim Trail.
•
Alexis was a previous owner of the fastest known time on the WRT, and the first women to break the 7hr mark, only to have her record beaten by 16 seconds just a month later.
•
As you might guess, this motivated Alexis to go home, train harder, then come back and take another shot. This time with her new #htSQD teammates in tow.
