2 words - Greg. Minnaar.
What more can we say about this man that hasn’t already been said?...I guess we can start with the number 22 as Greg increases his all-time leading Men's DH World Cup total to 22 wins on an AMAZING run in Lousã, Portugal that was almost 2 seconds faster than the rest of a tightly grouped field.
