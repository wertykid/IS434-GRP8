In this episode:
With 11 days until the British XC champs, Rab decides to mix things up. His physical shape is looking good - the numbers donâ€™t lie - but what about the mental preparations? Riding an indoor skatepark might not seem like ideal preparation for a national xc championship, but as we find out from some esteemed members of his cohort, the fun can be just as beneficial as physical gains.
