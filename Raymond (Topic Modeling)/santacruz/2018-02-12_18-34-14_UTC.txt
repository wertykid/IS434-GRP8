It's a big, wild, bike world out there...
While @jamienicolladventures & his Arctic Circle exploration crewâ€™s tires are sunk deep in the snows of winter up in the far north of Finland, the Santa Cruz enduro crew is 13,500 kilometers to the south, riding dusty trails in the warmth of summer in Santiago Chile for the @santacruzbicycles/@andespacifico 
The rest of us are most likely riding somewhere in between.
