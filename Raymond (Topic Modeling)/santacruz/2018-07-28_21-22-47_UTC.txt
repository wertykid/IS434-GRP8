With so many top 🇫🇷 World Cup riders this season, the French National DH Championship in Morzine was a highly anticipated event, especially for our own @lorisvergier who went in feeling in top form...but the weather decided otherwise and turned the finals into a slop-fest.
🌧🐈🐕🌧
Camaraderie remained high though, and the riders had about as much fun as they could on track that was almost unrideable by the time the highest ranked riders came down.
Cest la vie...
