#tbt to that time we launched the Heckler eMTB, and everyone lost their minds...

Wait, that was only 2 weeks ago? Damn, a lot has happened in those short weeks with a bunch of Hecklers shipped out and already in the hands of their new owners.
Same is true for the happy new owners of V10â€™s, Megatowerâ€™s, Bronsonâ€™s, Blurâ€™s, Tallboyâ€™s, or any of our 14 different bike models.
Enjoy your new bikes friends, and donâ€™t let other people tell you what you should and shouldnâ€™t like.
Stay on the appropriate trails, and get out there and have a good time.
Weâ€™ll be doing the same.
