Justin Robinson takes 3rd at Cyclocross Nationals!
We've been watching @bigandburly race cross for more than 20 years, and he never ceases to amaze. 
After BREAKING his ribs in a bad crash hopping barriers in practice on Wednesday, Justin powered his #StigmataCC through the pain on Thursday, taking the nice holeshot shown here and finishing 3rd overall in masters. 
A big (but gentle) high-five to Justin!
