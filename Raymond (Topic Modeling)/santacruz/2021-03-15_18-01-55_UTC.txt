First race of the season, first win of the season for the newly formed Santa Cruz #htSQD!💥

The 2021 Cactus Cup consisted of a 3-day stage race starting with a TT on Friday, XC Saturday, and enduro Sunday. Friday's TT was an all-out effort to set the stage for some tight racing over the weekend in a stacked field.

After three days of racing in the Arizona Desert:
Keegan: 1st in XC and 1st overall🥇
Tobin: 4th in XC and 6th overall
Alexis: 5th in Saturday's XC and 6th overall
