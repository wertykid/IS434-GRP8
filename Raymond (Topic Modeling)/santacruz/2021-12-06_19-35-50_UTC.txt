Chris King Open House 2021 - SRAM X Stigmata
•
Slightly controversial for the purists, but we love a good flat bar cross/gravel bike. 
Building one up used to be a bit of a chore trying to match up Road and MTB components, but the crew at SRAM made it whole lot easier with @sramroad AXS and @srammtb AXS being cross-compatible🤝
Add to this the stunning limited edition Matte Slate/Turquoise Chris King components and it’s one dialed looking build here. 
So clean!✨
