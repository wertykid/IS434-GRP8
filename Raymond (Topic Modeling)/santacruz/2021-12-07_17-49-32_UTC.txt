Old Enough To Know Better | Rab Wardell | Ep. 1 
‚Ä¢
@rabwardell is striving, fighting, and living his life full of fire and joy. His dreams are still bright, and at 36 his desire to compete at the highest level, and be the best athlete he can be, is a chance for all of us to analyze if we should ever be "old enough to know better‚Äù
‚Ä¢
In the first episode of this four-part series, Rab takes a look back at where it all began, in the foothills of Fife, through to the crushing disappointment of the 2006 commonwealth games, and how that has led to where he is now, including his FKT on the West Highland way in 2020. He begins to ask the question, at 36, should he know better than to risk reliving past pains, or is chasing dreams always worthwhile?
