“Bleak, bare, brutal.
Coronet Peak was the location today. 
First lap: snow, hail and freezing temperatures at the top of the trail. I had to look where my feet were as I couldn't feel my pedals. My fingers were long gone. Lap two of the second day was the hardest, most gruelling of the whole campaign, even the ascent in the dark and rain didn't warm me up. It’s the closest I've ever come to falling asleep at the bars. My 'blinks' were questionable. I found some yellow foam matting used for the ski fields under cover and had a quick nap at the top, it was the comfiest I think I'd ever been. Rolling into the snow to start the descent took next level will power.

Lap three I was welcomed midway up the climb by friends, Steve and Gnomes, carrying water bottles, warm drinks and warm smiles. They possessed the enthusiasm I'd forgotten about that morning. I felt alive again, fuelled by their encouragement and fancy English breakfast tea. The sun eventually did come out on day two and it got warm. The trails were busy and the morning, only a few hours before, seemed like a distant memory. Once again I was joined by good sorts for laps up and down, listening to their conversation passed the climbs and the growing monotony.

The descent was mainly down ‘Rude Rock’, a Queenstown classic. I rode it in snow, slop, hero dirt, and dust powder all within a few hours. A hill bomb down the road to finish aided recovery from a well trodden tourist trail, luckily the day before made the knuckle tearing more tolerable. Rubbing Deep Heat between my fingers helped too...”
