The @ca_enduro series wrapped up last weekend up in Ashland, Oregon!
*We do realize OR is not CA, but with the series also having a stop in Mexico, these guys don’t let geography stop them from finding a great trails to race on...🤷🏻‍♂️🤘
With a 3rd place finish, @mikeleechico wrapped up the overall season championship🏆 aboard his #Tallboy4, while Ashland local @nathan_riddler took the win on the day 🥇aboard his #BlurCC Trail
