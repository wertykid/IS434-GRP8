Resident shredder here at the Santa Cruz factory - Scott Chapin - dialed in his new #Chameleon7, pinned it for 33 miles, and won the Old Cabin Classic pro singlespeed race last weekend  on our local trails in Santa Cruz. Then Chapin stepped off the podium and handed his winning check over to the @mountainbikersofsantacruz to help maintain the local trail network that all of us here at @santacruzbicycles get to ride on every day.
Next time you see @scottchapinator at a race or trail near you, make sure to give him an extra high-five. Or even better, buy him a beer, 'cause he just gave away all his beer money...
