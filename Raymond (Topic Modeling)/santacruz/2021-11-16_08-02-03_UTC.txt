At last! 
Almost two and a half years after the curtain was drawn on the last ever Trans-Provence, we can finally unveil that infamous event's successor:
Stone King Rally Vol. 1
28 June - 03 July 2022
â€¢
The Santa Cruz Stone King Rally is the evolution of backcountry MTB enduro competition. Containing the same blend of wild adventure and gravity racing excitement that Trans-Provence introduced in 2009 and refined over the course of a decade, is now taken to new levels on a 100% original itinerary. 269km of transalpine crossings and 20,153m of singletrack descending over six days from the Alps to the Mediterranean.
â€¢
The race is limited to 100 riders, and will open for entries on Tuesday 30th November, 2021
