THE SYNDICATE - Leogang Quali’s
•
Alright friends, it’s been a while, but we have ourselves some World Cup DH racing! 
Track was fast and dry up top, then slow, sticky & slippery down below and little mistakes were easy to come by. 
Qualifying results:
@gregminnaar P12
@luca_shaw P36
Both riders feeling good, and ready to find some mud magic for the finals✌️
