Bike Check - @transcascadia
Mullet Party in the Woods🤘

#BronsonMX was the ride of choice for the Santa Cruz crew at the 2021 Trans Cascadia.
27.5” in the back for quick decisions and quicker cornering with the blind enduro TC format.
29” up front for rolling over unexpected  trail features and a little added grip for last-minute line choices.

Walker ran a 32t chainring but said if he did it all over again he would prob would have run a 34t for the for the fast descents. Tobin ran a 34t and said he’d probabaly choose a 32t next time for the steep climbs.
Looks like we need a 33t @srammtb! 😉
