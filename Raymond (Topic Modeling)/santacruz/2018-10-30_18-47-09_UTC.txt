@creativeconcept.tv + @steelcitymedia showcase @StevePeat's custom line from his #GAMBLEfilm segment, which was a huge undertaking from start to finish, but through a tonne of hard work in conjunction with Bike Track, Sheffield City Council and countless other helpers, the trail will hopefully inspire and become a track for wider use in the future.
