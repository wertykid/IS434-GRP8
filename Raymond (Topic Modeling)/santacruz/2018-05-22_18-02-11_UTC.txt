Blast From The Past.
@Pinkbike is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year which means a few trips down memory lane are in order. For this installment, they are turning the time machine dial to 2001.
Cool to see the old 2001 generation Super 8 ver2 in there along with many a Bullit in the linked Freeride videos, and ABSOLUTELY CRAZY to be reminded that 17 years ago the World Cup DH Series was a battle between @stevepeat, @gregminnaar, Nico Vouilloz, and Mickael Pascal, with Greg Minnaar taking the overall World Cup 2001 title...Greg Freakin' MInnaar!
The more things change, the more they stay the same.
