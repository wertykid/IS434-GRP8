2020 marks @KathySessler’s 17th year at the helm of The Syndicate.
In all that time there have only ever been 6 team riders, so clearly she is doing something right. When riders sign, they become part of the family. It can be no easy task dealing with a team of such individual and larger than life characters. No doubt her past experience as a bike-riding stunt women comes in handy keeping them all in check. Then as a past successful racer herself, she knows what a rider needs to do their best. With top ten World Cup DH results and a masters World Champs in the 90’s she almost matches her riders resumes, earning her nickname “One Fast Mother”

Taking on a lot more than just cooking and booking she invests herself emotionally with the team too. She’s handy with the camera, puts out sponsor books, hosts a mid season team Christmas dinner with presents and all, she keeps them distracted when they need it and focussed when it’s time to perform. On race day there is always hidden Champagne on ice in the pits in case one of her boys win, but she will just as graciously gift it to another team with a winning rider. True class!
•
It’s very much a two way relationship and her boys have been showing their appreciation by gifting her a unique charm to fill a very special bracelet she began building in 2008. Each win, big result or special milestone is recorded with the appropriate keepsake of gold, silver, diamonds, sapphires, onyx, wood and Murano glass. 
Roskopp, Bryceland, Peaty and Minnaar all filling one in four short years. The second edition is already in the making, we hope you have room on your wrist for many more… We love you Kathy.
