| Sundays With Sven 
â€¢
My first ever World Cup I raced was Kaprun 2003. It was also the first time I ever raced in the mud, the first time I rode spikes and my qualifying run was the first time I ever used flats (clips simply wouldnâ€™t work) Hailing from Southern California at the time I had no experience in wet weather conditions. I remember asking Greg Minnaar, who I barely knew at the time, what the trick or technique was, he advised me to ride it like its dry and if I felt it sliding get on the pedals and power down for grip. He placed 2nd in the final, I just qualified and ended up 52nd.

For most mere mortals, mud means mayhem but for the cream of the crop, like the Syndicate, they still, somehow, manage to ride it like itâ€™s dry. While practise, familiarity, tire choice, suspension settings and skilful technique go a long way in making mud manageable itâ€™s really mental fortitude that allows you to stay off the brakes commit to the big high wet rooty off-camber lines come race day. You either have it or you donâ€™t.

Some tracks benefit from moisture at some point in the week, preferably Thursday or Friday to offer prime racing conditions come Sunday, but then there are those odd occasions when no matter your pedigree when you add ill timed showers to hard pack clay all you are left with is a dice roll and a hail Mary. Lourdes 2017 springs to mind here. Ruts, roots, roll-offs, and raincoats, ironically all regularly feature during the summer European race season. High temperatures & even higher mountains fuel & feed the sudden violent & often recalcitrant thunderstorms.
â€¢
For a photographer itâ€™s a double edged sword. I love the rain for all its drama, contrast & creativity it brings. Old venues painted with a new patina, vivid saturation, wet rich greens and dark muddy moody contrasts pierced, sliced and spiced with streaking rain are a blessing but when itâ€™s accompanied by wind or humidity, it quickly turns into an expensive, frustrating, blurry mess of foggy sensors and short circuited systems.
â€¢
What will the return to racing bring? Iâ€™ll definitely still be packing the gore tex and brollies, maybe even a snow parka.
