THE SYNDICATE 2018 Episode 4
As the sun rises over the Alps in Les Gets, France, two warriors emerge from the mist. Backed by former and future World Champions, these two heroes will battle for supremacy on the beloved DH track at Crankworx Les Gets.
To the West is @marshguard , a wily dog past his prime, but capable of vigorous displays of Old Man Strength. To the East is @p.a_morzine , the young gun behind the young gun, predisposed by birth to excited outbursts and sketchy lines? 
Who will emerge victorious???
