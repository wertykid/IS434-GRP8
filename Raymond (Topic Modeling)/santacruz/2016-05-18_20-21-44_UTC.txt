- No Reception In Northern California | @theradavist - 
Our friends here in the Bay Area - @MissionWorkshop & @Taylorstitch - really know how to put together a spur of the moment road trip. No itinerary, no schedule, no obligations and no reception. Just bikes, boards, beers, and an agenda to get out into our extended back yard of coastal California. Check more epic images and words at @theradavist and be ready to have a strong desire to start making plans for your summer escape....#vwdoka #bronson #hightower #tayloredmission
