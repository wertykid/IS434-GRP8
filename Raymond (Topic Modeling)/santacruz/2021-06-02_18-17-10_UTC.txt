The New Blur - ‘XC’ Build
•
The XC Build option for the new Blur is all about light weight & efficiency, while remaining full-featured.
100mm forks and 100mm Superlight™ rear wheel travel keep things quick and snappy.
Single twistlock for remote lockout front & rear keeps the cockpit tidy even with shifter and dropper post controls. 
Yes, you also get a dropper in every XC build kit option, room for 2+ water bottles and 2.4” Maxxis Aspen tires for the utmost confidence in a World Cup race ready package, with full-build options coming in under 23lbs. Let’s go!🚀
