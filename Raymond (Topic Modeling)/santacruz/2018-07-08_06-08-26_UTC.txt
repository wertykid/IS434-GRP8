In what ended up being a dry and dusty finals in the big roots and bigger rocks of Val di Sole, @luca_shaw battled back from a slipped pedal early, making up time all the way down and ending up with a spot on the podium in 4th. 
@lorisvergier was not as lucky, as a crash at the very top ended his chances for top finish, but he gathered his V10 and pinned the rest of the run to end up 45th, with his jersey looking a little worse for wear.
Short rest week as Vallnord qualifying is only 5 days away, and the possible return of captain @gregminnaar #gettingthebandbacktogether
