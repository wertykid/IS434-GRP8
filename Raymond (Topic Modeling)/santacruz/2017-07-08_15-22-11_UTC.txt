Minnaar Takes Lenzerheide!
- What more can we say about @gregminnaar...21st World Cup win and his 75th World Cup podium.
- @LucaShaw with a great finals run earns him a 6th place finish, just off of the podium.
- @LorisVergier - An unfortunate wash-out in the very first corner eliminated his chance at a top finish, but his 27th place gives him enough points to retain his 4th in the overall.
