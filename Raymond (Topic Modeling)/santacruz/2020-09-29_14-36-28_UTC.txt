You might remember Ben from the @srammtb story about his amazing feat of climbing 55,000 vertical meters in 30 days while still working full-time as a bike mechanic at @vertigo_bikes_queenstown
We’re interested to see what he gets up to in the near future...we wouldn’t be surprised to see Ben try and outdo himself😉
