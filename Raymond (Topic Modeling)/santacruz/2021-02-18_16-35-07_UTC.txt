@vitalmtb Bike Of The Day - Worldâ€™s Heaviest Megatower
(This was actually the Vital bike of the day last week but we had other things going on.)
â€¢
We love @charliesponselâ€™s Megatower here. 2 different brakes, knackered components, 2 different generation XT pedals and worn-in/worn-out tires.
So basically, Team Robot Team IssueðŸ¤˜
â€¢
The truth is that he rides the hell out of it and eventually some components are consumables. Replace what you need and keep it rolling.
