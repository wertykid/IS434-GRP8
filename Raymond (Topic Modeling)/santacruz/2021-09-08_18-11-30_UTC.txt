Further - The Yes Generation - @shimanomtb
•
The US MTB trail-building scene always needs more champions, and John Groom and his coworkers at the @u.s.forestservice Truckee Ranger District are a great example.
•
Groom is among a new, younger generation of Forest Service officers with a vested interest in new trail construction. In an agency tasked with huge responsibilities, from fire management to watershed restoration, recreation within the Forest Service has historically sat on the back burner. However, Groom prioritizes recreation, saying “yes” to public desires for more trails, and he works to provide more recreational opportunities.
