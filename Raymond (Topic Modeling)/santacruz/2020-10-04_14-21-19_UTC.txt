Sundays With Sven 
One Shot

I only got to race three World Champs, a flat tire bookended with two (ok three) over the bars summed my worlds experience during my short lived DH “career”. However it’s the memories and immense feeling of pride and patriotism when donning the green and gold “big five animal” South African Jersey, representing the rainbow nation alongside much more accomplished riders like Anka and Greg Minnaar is something that I’ll cherish forever. They got issued skin suits, but for some reason the federation decided the baggy rugby jersey would better suited to me.

While the World Cup series title proves who the best rider is all year, there’s no denying the allure and pull of the magical rainbow jersey, one only has to look at Steve Peats’s 17 year quest to appreciate this. In it’s time the Syndicate has amassed 11 medals, four of them gold and they are just getting warmed up with young fresh talent from the bench now ready to make their own mark in the history books alongside Minnaar who is no doubt looking to snag a few more before he calls it a day, few can raise their game for the big matches like the lanky South African🇿🇦

Then there are the kits and matching bikes. The bikes, wow there have been some gems, each year something unique drawing from fresh inspiration and providing that little  extra bit of motivation.  Some years the designs are personal and detailing cryptic and others follow a team theme thread, but it’s the patriotic ones that do it for me and stand the test of time.

It’s been company tradition that every winning bike ends up in the hands of the sports biggest super fan, none other than our very own Rob Roskopp, so it took a special kind of shell game, bike box switcheroo heist at the Canberra airport for Sir Steve PEAT to retain rightful ownership of his gold winning chariot. Rob had to settle for the replica this time around.

What will this years bikes look like? Decals, paint and powder coat, we’ve seen it all. With all three riders ready to give it their all, will Roskopp need to make some more space on his wall?
