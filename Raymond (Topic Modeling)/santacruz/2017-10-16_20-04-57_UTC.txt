We didn't announce it at the time, but a full year before @danny_macaskill was out riding staircases in Glasgow with no rear tire, he was testing pre-production #SantaCruzReserve Carbon rims in his film, A Wee Day Out. 
The same Reserve carbon rims you can get from us today on Santa Cruz bikes, and from our new Reserve aftermarket wheel program. 
Check out the /wheels section of our website for more details.
