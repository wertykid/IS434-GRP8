@nathan_riddler with 2nd place finish in the #DownievilleClassic Downhill! After accepting his award Nathan stepped off the podium and donated his winnings check to the @sierratrails stewardship to help fund trail maintenance and to help build future trails in the Downieville area. You're a good man Nathan Riddle. #givingitback
