The Syndicate - World Champs Qualifying in Val di Sole ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹
â€¢
Greg continuing to show us that he can fit into any box, under any circumstance, at any time. P4 seems to be his happy place.
Luca laying down another strong run and not letting the dust, or the holes phase him. P12 for him.
Bring on the finals!
