Whoa. We have seen a lot of really nice & unique Santa Cruz bike builds as the @vitalmtb #BikeOfTheDay this year, but this #HightowerLT Custom Norwegian Snow Leopard Edition from owner @marna_o has to be the nicest of 2017 (just in time) and may just break the bike section of the internet for a bit. 
Custom wrapped by Marna O herself! Insane!!
Check out the full build and more pics at the vital link in our profile 👍
