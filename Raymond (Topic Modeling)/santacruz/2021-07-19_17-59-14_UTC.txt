The Santa Cruz #htSQD takes on the @belgianwaffleride California.

After a great start on Friday night with @mctubbbin winning the Crit-Cross race🥇, the guys were looking for some top results in Sunday’s 132 mile course with a mix of pavement and gravel and over 11,000 feet of climbing.
@keegels99 was up front and feeling good at 90miles in, then went down hard on a fast gravel descent.
After gathering himself back up and straightening out his bars and fixings his chain, Keegan charged back to finish in the top 10 overall 💪
Then Keegan got to celebrate by going back to the van to scrub the dirt & grime from his road rash…
Ah the racing life🤘
