It’s #DownievilleClassic All-Mountain time and @nathan_riddler Is getting his bike dialed in 🤘
Running the #Blur is a big change as it’s the least amount of suspension travel he’s ever run for The Classic, but he’s been laying down practice runs and thinks it’s the ticket ⚡️
Tomorrow morning is going to come too soon and there’s a long climb out of Sierra City waiting. Good luck Nathan! 🤜💥🤛
