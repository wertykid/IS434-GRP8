Sundays With Sven
•
The Syndicate is primarily known as a thoroughbred DH race team, but like most of us they also spend a lot of time on their short travel bikes. They might not admit it but they also love to race a bit of enduro when the seasons schedule allows for it and have competed in a handful of EWS events over the years.

Greg, the ever competitive racer didn’t waste time getting stuck in during the early formative years of the Enduro World Series. The chance to race past nemeses Fabien Barel and Nico Vouilloz again was probably enough to get Minnaar to sign up. In only his second Enduro World Series event he managed to land himself on the Podium in third place alongside fellow World Champions Nico and Graves, proving that should he choose to he could also master this longer more endurance focussed form of gravity racing.

Steve gets to spend a lot more time on the “short travel” bikes these days and can often be seen matching the teams speeds during DH test camps on his enduro bike. During the early days of EWS he too showed his pedigree with some top ten finishes. These days we get to see him truly discover just how far & deep into the backcountry these bikes can take you in the wilder more adventurous enduro races like Trans Provence and the NZ Enduro, where mixing racing with beer stops is encouraged not frowned upon. Perfect for uncle Steve.

Having only competed in one EWS event in Finale as a season (B)ender which involved more beer, cappuccinos and gelato than serious effort Luca prefers to keep his focus strictly DH although when he chooses to he’s a force to be reckoned with, nabbing a Trans Cascadia podium in 2018.
•
Perhaps out of the bunch the one with the biggest Enduro fettish would be our famously fast Frenchie Loris Vergier. As a junior he took a win over the ever dominant Martin Maes then a few more legendary scalps with his Trans Cascadia win. If he didn’t have such a big future ahead of him in DH the enduro guys would have something to worry about.

With the EWS wrapping up this weekend in Finale lets reminisce on some of Syndicates early exploits and dabbling in Enduro World Series racing.
