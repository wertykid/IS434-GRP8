The Syndicate - French DH Cup, Les Orres.
•
No one would have guessed that the 2020 French Cup would end up feeling almost like a mini World Cup series this year, but here we are. 
With the impressive local French DH scene, and many of the top World Cup athletes itching to race, the field was packed with talent.

@luca_shaw was feeling good all week, but luck was not on his side as he got a rear flat right at the top of the mountain, ending his day. 
•
In the end @lorisvergier placed 4th on the day in Les Orres, but more importantly, Loris wrapped up the French Cup series overall title 🇫🇷🏆
Congratulations Loris!
