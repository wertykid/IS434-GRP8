Let The Heckling Begin
•
In 1996 the Heckler was created as a rude interruption to mountain bike designs of the time. Its solid, full suspension build and aggressive swagger proved that a well-proportioned trail bike could elevate rider’s on-trail experiences.
Today’s Heckler carries all that attitude forward into a new era - A full carbon frame, VPP suspension and pedal-assist merge to create a platform that feels light and agile yet with the power to make rare rides the norm.
