Great day on the hill in Snowshoe, West Virginia, with @luca_shaw taking 5th place on home soil🇺🇸
•
With World Champ @gregminnaar sidelined with a separated shoulder the pressure was on for Luca and he delivered with a scorching run and a spot on the podium for the last race of the season.
Cheers Luca!🍾
