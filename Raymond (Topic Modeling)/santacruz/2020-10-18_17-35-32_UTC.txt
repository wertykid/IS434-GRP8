Back To Back for THE SYNDICATE!
•
Loris Vergier with back-to-back wins at the first ever back-to-back world cup weekend!🏆🏆
•
What a wild one...Only 2 days after World Cup race #1, the track was mostly dry, racing was fast, competition was fierce and @lorisvergier goes fastest again! With @gregminnaar in 9th and @luca_shaw in 11th.
