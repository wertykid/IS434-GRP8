What's next after you Everest and then climb out of the stratosphere? The tallest plantery mountain in the solar system, that's what.
•
After Everesting a few years back, then climbing and descending 55,000 vertical metres in only 30 days last December, all while holding down his full-time bike-mechanic job at @vertigo_bikes_queenstown, the question many had for @benhildred was what's next?
•
It was his boss, Paul "Pangus" Angus, who suggested Olympus Mons, a volcano on the planet Mars that stands 21,287.4m (69,841ft) above datum, said to be the tallest planetary mountain in the solar system, roughly two and a half times the height of Mt. Everest. After exiting the stratosphere with his last attempt it made sense to continue further out into space to find the next ascent to conquer.
•
The Olympus Mons challenge is simple: Climb at least 21,288m in just 72 hours. Each day must consist of one ride, each ride must be on a different climb and descent loop, but the whole ride has to be completed on the same bike. Ben, being a Queenstown local did the whole thing on a mountain bike (a Tallboy), mostly off-road.

In November Ben led the first exhibition to figuratively climb Olympus Mons. For the next three days we'll recap his odyssey here on @santacruzbicycles
