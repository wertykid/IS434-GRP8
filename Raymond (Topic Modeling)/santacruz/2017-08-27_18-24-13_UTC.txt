The #SantaCruzSyndicate takes home the #1 Team trophy in Val di Sole.
It was an exciting world cup season with some new faces, new bikes, and the same top results we have come to expect from this crew.
We are extremely proud and honored to have them representing the brand and flying the Santa Cruz banner.
But it's not all over yet...bring on the 2017 UCI World Championships!
