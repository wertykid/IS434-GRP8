Santa Cruz Stigmata - Chris King Open House 2020 Build
â€¢
One of the things we look forward to at the end of each year is the Chris King Open House.
We build new bikes, with the about-to-be-launched @chriskingbuzz limited edition colors, then head to Portland Oregon to talk about bikes & bike advocacy, ride bikes, drink a beer or twoÂ  in Chris's barn, then show our bikes off at the public open house day at the Chris King factory. 
It's a damn good time with a lot of good people.
As you may have noticed, this was not a typical year so getting together in person was not in the cards but CK still managed to put on a show (check it out at chrisking.com) and launch some new colors which leads to this sweet build you see here.
