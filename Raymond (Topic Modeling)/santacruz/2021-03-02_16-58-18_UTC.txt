A Trail For Everyone

The Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship’s Lost Sierra Route isn’t just a trail project, it’s big picture thinking on a scale that’s a little hard to comprehend.
300 miles of epic multi-use singletrack linking Downieville and 15 other communities throughout the Sierra’s to connect people to each other and the nature around them.
