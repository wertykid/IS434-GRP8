For the Love of the Trail
There's a great article up on @pinkbike today that profiles one of the many trailwork efforts that our employees and @santacruzfactoryracing crew help out with on their weekends 'off'. This one in Ashland, Oregon along with the guys from @ashlandmountainadventures & @ca_enduro and organized on our side by our do'r of things @ac_fabz - Check out more of @mthomasphoto shots and the full article at the link in our profile.
