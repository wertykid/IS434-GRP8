The day after the #DownievilleClassic always feels like we just got back from a really good wedding. 
Beautiful scenery, lots of festivities, old friends, late nights, early mornings, and maybe a little too much to drink. It’s a happy kind of exhausted.
As title sponsor, we have been happily married to the Downieville Classic crew for many years...for better, for worse. 
Cheers @sierratrails, @yubaexpeditions, all the volunteers, and the town of Downieville. Thanks for everything you do. See you all next year ❤️
