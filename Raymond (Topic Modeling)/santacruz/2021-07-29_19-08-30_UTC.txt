21.1lb / 9.57kg Blur Superlightâ„¢ ðŸ¤¯
â€¢
Our product team set out build up an ultralight new Blur with a rideable-in-the-real-world component selection (This is no delicate vanity project.)
The hard work on the frame design was already done by our design team for the launch of the new #Blur.4.
The Dark Matter paint option was a project all itâ€™s own to reduce the weight of paint for production frames and this frame shown here was the proof of concept - 90g lighter than existing paint options.
Excuse me now while I go fight for a spot in line to take it out for the weekendðŸ¤ž
