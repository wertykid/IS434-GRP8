Steps to the Top - #htSQD

It’s been a pretty amazing season for our newly formed htSQD, comprised of 3 versatile, XC oriented riders taking on many of the hardest events the US has to offer. And coming away with a nice collection of 🏆’s.

The @srammtb crew joined them at the @breckepic stage race to document what has made this team gel so well, and become so successful this quickly✌️
