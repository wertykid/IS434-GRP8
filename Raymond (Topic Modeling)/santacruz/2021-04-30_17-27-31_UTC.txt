The Next Generation of DH Talent Under One Awning
•
During this last weird year of racing, and not racing, our friends at @steelcitymedia hatched a plan to bring together a group of young individual riders from around the world under a new ‘UNION’ banner and then support and nurture that riding talent, while also bringing on and developing new media talent to capture it all.
We were all-in🤝
•
The crew that’s assembled for 2021 are riders that we’ve been supporting through our distributors for a few years already, but now they’re unified under one tent and with room to grow.
The following riders will form the first chapter:
@tuhoto_ariki - NZD
@oliverzwar - SWE
@benzwar - SWE
@finnhb - NZD
@olliedavis.6 - AUS
•
This season you can find them based out of Morzine in @bikemorzine supported digs, before traveling to all of the UCI DH World Cups, Crankworx, select EWS races and more.
•
UNION is also backed by these loyal supporters:
@reservewheels

@maxxisbike
@trpcycling
@deitycomponents
@crankbrothers
@peatysproducts
@hktproducts
