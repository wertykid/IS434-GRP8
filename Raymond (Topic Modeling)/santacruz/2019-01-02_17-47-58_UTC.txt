This incredibly nice custom #HightowerLT was inspired by @lorisvergier's Worlds @scsyndicate #V1029er, and given away after the 2018 ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· DH National Championships in Morzine, in partnership with @morzineofficiel
Winner of the bike was @clement_gallay who came by to pick up the bike at the Santa Cruz Bicycles headquarters in Morzine. 
Congratulations Clement!
