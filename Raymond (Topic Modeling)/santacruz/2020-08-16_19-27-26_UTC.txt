From @scsyndicate:
“Track was super blown out and it was pretty tricky to find the pace but the guys killed it. Tough run for Greg, who had a crash early on. He then tried to push to make back time and got swallowed by the track again. Other than that, he was on top form all weekend and is luckily just a bit bruised! On to the next!”
