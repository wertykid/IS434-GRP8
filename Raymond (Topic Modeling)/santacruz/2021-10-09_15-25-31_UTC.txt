Five Riders Rides #3 - Myia: Finding the Medicine
•
Myia Antone is from Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw (the Squamish Nation) and is based in her hometown of Squamish, BC. She is a Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim (Squamish language) lifelong learner and teacher and is passionate about land-based education and language revitalization. She is the founder of @indigwomenoutdoors - a community-led organization that supports Indigenous women and non-binary community members get back out on the land.
•
Myia uses her Chameleon to reach further into the forest to find the plant medicines that her ancestors have been harvesting since time immemorial, but she's discovered the act of cycling is also medicinal.
