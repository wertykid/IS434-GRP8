| 2019 Bikepacking Gear Of The Year - Santa Cruz Carbon Chameleon |
“The new Santa Cruz Chameleon probably saw as many, if not more, miles than any bike we reviewed this year. It was simply very good at doubling as a trail bike and a bikepacking rig, so it came along for countless unloaded singletrack rides, as well as many bikepacking trips in the Southwest, through Arizona, New Mexico, and beyond - @bikepackingcom”
