@scsyndicate back on track in Metabief!
•
French DH Cup racing continued on a wet, muddy and slick course in Metabief, France.
Even the big dog got in on the action with Syndicate Head Coach @stevepeat blowing the dust off his trusty #V10 and suiting up for the race.
#FunFact, Peaty raced this track at 1993 World Champs as a literal teenager...27 years ago!🤯

With Qualis and Racing happening same day, it was a long one out there, but the Syndicate crew, as always, was up to the task✊
•
Finals:
@lorisvergier - 1st🏅
@gregminnaar - 2nd🥈
@luca_shaw - 9th
@stevepeat - 28th (Flatted)
Nice job out there @scsysndicate crew!
