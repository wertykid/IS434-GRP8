#Tallboy3 #TallboyCC #Tallboy
Behind the music with @songhoyblues - The idea behind the #Tallboy3 video was to bring together two of South Africa‚Äôs greatest mountain biking exports; downhill racer @gregminnaar and the Absa @capeepic MTB stage race. But the African connection didn‚Äôt stop there. The music track on the video - Al Hassidi Terei - is the work of a great band called Songhoy Blues from Mali, West Africa pictured above. 
The group is also one of the principal subjects of the powerful documentary film - They Will Have To Kill Us First - which chronicles Malian musicians‚Äö fight with the extremist forces that have seen music banned in much of the country. Read the full story in the news section of our website.

#Tallboy3 first look reviews are starting to roll in !

@bicyclingmag - "The Tallboy is an efficient bike: It feels quick and crisp; and the suspension is very quiet when climbing and accelerating, with little noticeable motion. Santa Cruz‚Äôs VPP system has always been efficient, but the latest iteration on this TB3 feels like the engineers have found a way to make the suspension even more efficient, but without noticeably sacrificing sensitivity. The bike feels fast, but stays connected when pedaling through rough bits, or up and over roots. Here‚Äôs that refrain I mentioned: The TB3 pedals like a shorter travel, XC-style bike, but has the sensitivity of a bike with more travel.‚Äù Check out the full review at the link in our profile. üì∑& words by Bicycling test director @ilikesushi

Jonas Johnson/@jcycletech is our product tech contact at @chriskingbuzz for the Santa Cruz Syndicate and has helped us out with countless projects that all needed to be done at a moments notice, so when Jonas asked for a little help getting his personal bike customized, we were happy to oblige. He knew he wanted the Bronson Kalimotxo frame but also had some inspiration in the form of a very colorful SDG Circuit Mtn Shibuya saddle and here is the result. Some may say too colorful, but i'll be damned if he didn't somehow pull it all off.

Wise words from Tobin Ortenblad / @mctubbbin - "It's funny how self expectation fluctuates throughout a race season. Coming into this year's cross season if you'd have told me I'd place fifth as a first year Elite at US cyclocross nationals, I would've been thrilled. After an incredible season with numerous C2 wins and even a C1 win I came into yesterday wanting more, wanting to win and knowing that I was in a position to do that. Yesterday was an insane race. Viewing the result from an overall season perspective, I am stoked. Three races to go this year, the racing is not over yet"

A very wet Day 2 of the @nzenduro made the already technical trails of the Nydia Bay sections even more treacherous, but apparently the extreme weather helped Scotsman @MarkScott259 feel right at home, winning three of the four stages and a second in the other.

The Chameleon has evolved.
As the name implies, the Chameleon is a Swiss army knife of bikes, capable of shifting from hardtail ripper to bikepacking mule and everything in between. 
Now adaptable from 29er to 27.5-plus, geared or singlespeed, the Chameleon utilizes a series of swappable dropouts to change modes.
With a low stance and laid-back geometry, the #Chameleon delivers that stable feel that defines the modern trail bike.
Hit the link in our profile for the full details!

#THESYNDICATE - Episode.2 - Loris

This time around we follow one of the newest recruits around his home in Cagne-sur-Mer. 
Loris gives us the lowdown on racing in denim, Ferrari-esque cars, and the fast-life of twisting throttles near white sandy beaches, and then it's on to Ft. William and Leogang for World Cup action with the whole team.

- What more can we say about @gregminnaar...21st World Cup win and his 75th World Cup podium.
- @LucaShaw with a great finals run earns him a 6th place finish, just off of the podium.
- @LorisVergier - An unfortunate wash-out in the very first corner eliminated his chance at a top finish, but his 27th place gives him enough points to retain his 4th in the overall.

#Singletrack6 Day 2
Alex McGuiness here - aka @krunk_shox - grabbed his #TallboyCC and drove the 15 hours from the thin air of Winter Park, CO to the high, dry Western Kootenay's of BC for the Singletrack6. On day 1 he finished 12th in the GC but also won the timed descent. In typical Krunk fashion he's taking a casual approach to proceedings until he gets on his bike, which is when he turns up the heat. The temperature and very low humidity is really testing riders and the dry, rocky, surprisingly technical (surprisingly for those not familiar with XC racing in BC) trails has meant racers are digging deep already. With 2 days down and 4 to go it could be a battle of attrition as well as ambition.

@lorisvergier takes you on a rough, rocky, and blazing fast run down the final @uci_cycling World Cup of 2017 in Val Di Sole, Italy.  Check out the full run at the link in our profile. Powered by #OakleyPrizm. #cantstop
Not even a wicked crash during practice could hold @gregminnaar back from his mission to finish the World Cup season on top.
With a 2nd in Qualifying and only 0.17 seconds off, Greg still holds the total points lead heading in to race day Saturday in Val di Sole.
@svenmartinphoto
Not the race we'd hoped for in Val di Sole, as @gregminnaar's rear tire went flat while up at the 2nd split by 1.4 seconds, costing him the overall points lead. Still an amazing season for the guys, and the big positives on the day were @lorisvergier with a blaming fast run taking 4th & @luca_shaw 8th. Bring on Worlds! 
@svenmartinphoto
The #SantaCruzSyndicate takes home the #1 Team trophy in Val di Sole.
It was an exciting world cup season with some new faces, new bikes, and the same top results we have come to expect from this crew.

But it's not all over yet...bring on the 2017 UCI World Championships!

@Luca_Shaw comes down the mountain in 8th at the Val di Sole World Cup and finishes the season in 13th overall.
While a few mishaps at a couple races kept Luca out of the top ten overall on the season, his consistent top results - Qualified 5 times in the top 10 & Finished 3 times in the top 10 - show that he's a 21 year old force to be reckoned with.

@svenmartinphoto
World Champs SPOILER ALERT 
Not the day we were hoping for in Cairns, but damn are we are proud of these guys. 
A great looking run lead to a 7th place finish for @lorisvergier.

An unfortunate slide out in the loose corner at the bottom of the rock garden ended @luca_shaw's chances at a medal but he got back on his bike and still finished in 26th.

@gregminnaar had another spectacular run going and was only 0.3 down at the first split, when his rear tire went flat for the second race in a row. This one was the hard, as Greg's run was looking so good and we all know how strong of a peddler he can be at the bottom of a course where that is what can make-it or break-it. Just not meant to be this time around. 
Hard to believe the 2017 DH season is over, but we are already looking forward to 2018. The boys will be back...with a vengeance. 
Big thanks to all of our sponsors, and everyone that helps make THE SYNDICATE the best team on dirt.

Santa Cruz is proud to announce sponsorship of the 2018 French National DH Championships in Morzine from July 26-28, 2018.

Working in partnership with the Morzine-Avoriaz Tourism Office and the Pleney Lift Company, Santa Cruz is helping develop a brand new DH track for the occasion, on the legendary Pleney mountain.

Syndicate rider @lorisvergier will be there to compete for National honors with the full backing of his @scsyndicate team.  For the past few seasons, teammates @gregminnaar and @luca_shaw have used Morzine as their home from home for training and, erm, not training. Meanwhile team mentor @stevepeat has even taken up residency!

How do you summarize the Andes-Pacifico to someone who hasn‚Äôt ridden it? The terrain is brutal, the anti-grip takes ages to get your head around, the days are long, the hike-a-bikes relentless and the temperatures will burn Northern Hemisphere winter skin in a heartbeat. Sounds like hell, right?

This is @nicbean_ . If you demoed a bike from the Factory here in Santa Cruz recently, there‚Äôs a good chance Nic was the one who set up your ride for you. 
In 2017 Nic raced with the EWS team at Aspen and Whistler but this year he‚Äôs making a go for the overall; the Jr. World Champ title. The EWS made a new rule for 2018 that only the best five finishes of eight races will count for the Junior Overall; financially this is great for up and coming riders as it allows them to compete on the world stage.
Nic finished 18th in a field of 70 Juniors at @world_enduro Round 3 in France, which is a good start to see what he can do this season, and we are super excited to see what comes next...High-Five Nic! üñê

Blast From The Past.
@Pinkbike is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year which means a few trips down memory lane are in order. For this installment, they are turning the time machine dial to 2001.
Cool to see the old 2001 generation Super 8 ver2 in there along with many a Bullit in the linked Freeride videos, and ABSOLUTELY CRAZY to be reminded that 17 years ago the World Cup DH Series was a battle between @stevepeat, @gregminnaar, Nico Vouilloz, and Mickael Pascal, with Greg Minnaar taking the overall World Cup 2001 title...Greg Freakin' MInnaar!
The more things change, the more they stay the same.

@scsyndicate #santacruzsyndicate
With so many top üá´üá∑ World Cup riders this season, the French National DH Championship in Morzine was a highly anticipated event, especially for our own @lorisvergier who went in feeling in top form...but the weather decided otherwise and turned the finals into a slop-fest.
üåßüêàüêïüåß
Camaraderie remained high though, and the riders had about as much fun as they could on track that was almost unrideable by the time the highest ranked riders came down.

Digging @transcascadia ‚õè

A whole lot of hard work goes into building a 4 day point-to-point enduro course, so a couple of weeks ago we loaded up the trucks with supplies we‚Äôd need for a few days of remote trail work in preparation for #TransCascadia2018
A big benefit here is after the race is over, the new-built and re-built trails remain for all to enjoy, so it's a race that gives back in a big way to the riding community of the Pacific Northwest.
Check out the News section of our website for more words and photos to see why we feel @transcascadia is a special event.

A project two years in the making, THE NEW V10 has arrived! 
But wait, there are two?!
Oh yes...as we developed the V10.29er race bike for the @SCSyndicate, it became apparent that not all riders would fit on or prefer the 29‚Äù bike, so we made a 27.5 bike, too. To be clear, it's two completely different frames‚Äîthe production versions of both bikes were developed in parallel, and they‚Äôre both the recipients of two seasons of high-level suspension testing and tuning under the Syndicate.

Feel good story of our year...after winning #FiveBucksaFoot, our annual Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship fundraiser for @sierratrails, Michael Knighten of San Francisco was rewarded with his choice of any @santacruzbicycles MTB worth up to $10,000.
BUT instead of claiming the prize for himself,  Michael chose to generously donate five brand new Santa Cruz Chameleons worth $2,000 each to five kids in Plumas County, giving birth to a new program called Knights of the Lost Sierra.
Managed by Mandy Beatty, the STBS Trails Program Coordinator, #KnightsOfTheLostSierra was an open application to any Plumas County youth interested in volunteering 10 separate 5-hour days at SBTS events and trail days, working 50 total hours to ownership of a new mountain bike. 
Over the last year, five youths put in the time and effort, each earning themselves a brand new mountain bike thanks to Michael‚Äôs generosity.
‚ÄúMy favorite thing about this program is the long-term commitment the participants made to service and their public lands‚Äù said Mandy Beatty. ‚ÄúWe started digging on trail days in the snow, sweated it out on Mt Hough and Cascade Trail, and were chasing daylight and cold in the Basin. 
Participants saw and experienced their public lands through all the seasons and it wasn‚Äôt an instant gratification process.‚Äùüí™

We have a Stewardship page on our website. It doesn‚Äôt get a ton of traffic compared to the rest of the site, and hey, we get it. There are a lot of beautiful bikes to look at.
But we also know that without trail builders & trail advocacy efforts we wouldn‚Äôt have anywhere to use those beautiful bikes, so we spend a lot of our time, energy and our money to help those efforts. 
Santa Cruz Bicycles employees get paid days off to go work on trails, both local, and on travel trips. Often times they do it for free. Sometimes they do it for beer. 
In 2018 alone we had 1,411 employee hours volunteered for advocacy, and donated $400,155 to support new trails and for trail maintenance on existing trails.
Most importantly we work with and support many amazing North American trail advocacy organizations including Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship, Mountain Bikers of Santa Cruz (MBoSC), Land Trust of Santa Cruz County (LTSC), Sustainable Trails Coalition (STC), International Mountain Bike Association (IMBA), Trans-Cascadia, Central Oregon Trail Alliance (COTA), Northwest Trail Alliance (NWTA), and more. 
And over the last couple years we have been expanding our reach to international trail advocacy efforts world-wide. 
We can post pretty bike pictures all day long, in fact we love posting those pics, but without the help of all the people and organizations mentioned above there would be a lot less awesome trails out there for all of us to ride on. 
How can you help? Search online or ask your local bike shop if there are local trail building groups you can assist. Get involved and do what you can. Every little bit helps.
And hug your local trail builder today‚ù§Ô∏è

| Stoked On MS Bronson CC - The Details in the Design |
‚Ä¢
When we asked Andy McKenna for inspiration for the design of the @stokedonms benefit bike he said that it had to stand out, look unlike any Santa Cruz Bronson anyone could currently buy, but also look so cool that the raffle winner would still want to ride it.
The topographic design nearly hidden in the orange parts of the paint aren't just generic squiggles but was taken from the old Ordinance Survey maps of the Torridon region in the Scottish Highlands, a place Andy regards above nearly anywhere on earth. 
Part of the reason for Andy's love of the area is that he's spent so much time with his wife, @mrsgowherescotland, staying in bothies, sleeping in bivys  and exploring deep into the area's trails.

Introducing our new Reserve Carbon 700c & 650b gravel wheels.
‚Ä¢
Gravel riding offers a bit of roll-your-own style, but these types of races and rides favor light weight over bump absorption, so most opt to leave the suspension at home. This is where the new Reserve700c and 650b wheels really shine.

Gutted for @lorisvergier as he slides out late on a run that would surely have put him on the podium and ending up 19th, but Andorra is next and the site of where Loris won last year...the @scsyndicate will be ready!

How do you sum up a weekend like the Downieville Classic? Well for one, it's way more than just a weekend ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a way of life for the great people of the Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship and the Downieville community. They have created a modern-day success story. Not the kind of success where some faceless megacorp behemoth makes an over countable amount of money at the expense of the little man. Nope. The kind of success story where a small town on the brink of collapse is now one of the most revered destinations in all of mountain biking - while at the same time creating jobs, trails and a community striving to do good in this world...

Continuing our V10.7 development story from yesterday, here is our senior industrial designer @dogbox‚Äôs incredible custom #V1029er.
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúThe V10 7 29 was the first Santa Cruz DH bike were I was part of the design team. Downhill has always been my favorite type of riding, and to be able to lead the industrial design for such a legendary DH bike was a something special. I knew I would want a personal V10 29 after riding the engineering test bikes, and it would be cool to have a unique paint job for my bike. 
A few years ago I was at the National Championship Air Race in Reno and saw Planes of Fame's P51-A Miss Virginia. Not to be confused with the Packard built Merlin powered P51-D, Miss Virginia is a P51-A powered by Allison. Also flying still is the AAF's B-25 ‚ÄòExecutive Sweet‚Äô with this same livery of the 1st Air Commando Group. I figured this livery would look pretty cool on a V10.‚Äù

‚ÄúSanta Cruz has knocked it out of the park with this new Stigmata. I honestly can‚Äôt speak to how this bike will perform in a road or cross race but I‚Äôm sure it will hold its own. For my needs, this bike delivered exactly what I was looking for. A solid, reliable ride that won‚Äôt rattle my fillings loose. I found the Stigmata to be just as eager to deliver power on demand as it was to persevere when asked. Whether on short, rowdy rides or multi-day adventures, the Stig is the rig...‚Äù

Our new Hightower is up for the 2019 @pinkbike awards - Mountain Bike Of The Yearü§ò
‚Ä¢
Why it's nominated, ‚ÄúThe Hightower's versatility is its strong suit, with enough travel to navigate all but the hairiest descents, and balanced geometry that gives it the ability to remain enjoyable on a wide range of terrain. The shock tune is well matched to the VPP suspension design, with plenty of traction for the slippery stuff, and enough support for grinding out those big climbs...‚Äù

@bikemag - The Most Influential Bikes of the Decade - 2010 Santa Cruz Nomad Carbon
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúThe Nomad was known as an overbuilt, rough-and-ready bike edging toward the freeride end of the spectrum, rather than the afternoon-ride end. To most people's surprise, the Nomad C was everything Santa Cruz claimed it would be. It was light (for the time), fast and most importantly, fun. The general reaction to it was something along the lines of, "Holy S#*t."

@bikemag - The Most Influential Bikes of the Decade - 2013 Santa Cruz Bronson
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúThe Bronson was a do-it-all, for-the-fun-of-it play bike. It wasn't committed to any one style of riding, rather it just wanted to be out on the trail having a good time. It jumped well, pedaled well, cornered well and, well, did just about everything well. And that was what most people loved about the Bronson‚Äîit didn't matter what kind of rider you were, you'd probably have a lot of fun on it.  Santa Cruz convinced the public that 27.5 wheels worked and, soon after its release, most of the other big-name brands started churning out their own 27.5 creations‚Äù

Let The Heckling Begin
‚Ä¢
In 1996 the Heckler was created as a rude interruption to mountain bike designs of the time. Its solid, full suspension build and aggressive swagger proved that a well-proportioned trail bike could elevate rider‚Äôs on-trail experiences.
Today‚Äôs Heckler carries all that attitude forward into a new era - A full carbon frame, VPP suspension and pedal-assist merge to create a platform that feels light and agile yet with the power to make rare rides the norm.
‚Ä¢
The New Heckler:
- 150mm VPP¬Æ rear travel, 160mm fork
- 27.5-inch wheels
- 504wh battery capacity
- 65.5-degree head angle
- Available in CC carbon
- Reserve DH/30 carbon wheel option
- Lifetime warranty - Sizes: S-XXL

#LetTheHecklingBegin
When someone like Greg Williams tells you that you should really hurry up and make an e-bike you pay attention.

Greg has said for a long time that the Lost Sierras is ‚Äúa big empty space full of empty trails‚Äù. Some of these trails have been under the nose of riders for years, they‚Äôre just protected by nightmare climbs that deter even the toughest riders. But with the help of a little boost these pieces of singletrack shoot you right from town, fast-forwarding through the torment of 5000ft climbs, to trails like Chimney Rock and Empire Creek - the exact kinds of trails that the title ‚Äúworld‚Äôs best downhill trail‚Äù was made for.

Heckler makes rare rides the norm, turns climbs into sections of trail to enjoy and it‚Äôs still as agile and capable as a regular bike so you can enjoy the really great bits of trail. It was made for places like the Lost Sierras and for adventurous, imaginative riders like Greg Williams.

What do you think about a weekend trip to Downieville?‚Äù Seb didn‚Äôt offer many details, and I didn‚Äôt ask.

In February 2020, before everything seemed to change, we sent four of our riders to Chile to find the riding hotspots. But as much as this film is about the places they visited it‚Äôs about the times they shared and the energy they multiplied. This film is about hanging out with friends and celebrating every minute of the day together.
‚Ä¢
Each of these riders is different in every way except that they love two wheels. They show their love differently ‚Äì flat pedals, clips, small wheels, big wheels, Megatowers, Bronsons, race pace, game face, battling for the clip or dance offs at night. This is a film where crass and class aren‚Äôt at odds, where style and speed aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive, where it‚Äôs possible to see that opposites aren‚Äôt incompatible they‚Äôre complimentary.
‚Ä¢
Note: While we‚Äôre in the midst of this global pandemic please respect local health advisories, keep your distance and make clever decisions. The smarter we are now the sooner we‚Äôll all be back out on the trails with friends.

Although Santa Cruz, California is in a shelter-in-place like most of the world, Santa Cruz Bicycles‚Äô R&D team is at work producing face shields (PPE) for local medical staff using sheets of plastic cut using their CNC machinery typically used for cutting carbon fiber as well as 3D printers used for prototyping. 
The equipment is able to make up to 20 face shield lenses every 9 minutes, yielding ~1000 shields per day. Ten days were spent evaluating designs, developing multiple prototypes and getting feedback from local healthcare professionals to ensure the end product suited their needs.  3D printers are used to make reusable and sterilizable support frames using open source CAD designs. Enough material has been procured to produce 8,000 face shields in two different designs in the next week. 75 face shields from the pilot run were delivered to the Santa Cruz County Donation Center today. The team isn‚Äôt working in isolation, this is a community effort, working with volunteers, medical professionals and other local companies to coordinate efforts into effective and rapid action to address the anticipated needs. 
With a little help from everyone, we‚Äôll get through this together and come out as an even tighter community on the other side.

‚ÄúDescending on the Heckler was quite surprising. On smoother bermy trails I was generally faster. The low slung weight, much of it below the front axle, seems to propel you forward and sink confidently into corners. At times it feels like a stabilizing gyro in the middle of your bike, and I often found a next level of comfort and confidence in the air...‚Äù

What‚Äôs really nice is to see them already in the hands of first responders that have been helping mountain bikers for years in some of our favorite riding spots - Downieville, Sierra City, Graeagle, Quincy and more, thanks to our friends at @sierabuttes & @lureresort üëç

A new weekly series that chronicles the intimate moments between photographer Sven Martin & The Santa Cruz Syndicate.
‚Ä¢
As a photographer, time is normally a commodity I severely lack in life but as a mountain bike photographer specializing in racing, it's something I now have in abundance. It's been a cathartic and fulfilling process dusting off the old hard drives. Sorting, cataloguing and compiling my favourite images and memories they evoke. A task that, no doubt, would have been left until retirement if it weren‚Äôt for these current times.
-
When following, documenting and photographing a singular subject over¬† such a long period of time, certain patterns and story lines emerge. If a picture is worth a thousand words then I have a volume of encyclopedias filled with stories, memories and intimate moments documenting the Santa Cruz Syndicate over the past fifteen years.
-
Where and how does one even begin a project like this? A team of such stature, steeped in both legend and glory with titles and records and the personalities to match. Actually the answer is easy. Steve Peat! The one and only, who, like a fine wine, just keeps getting better with age. From securing the World Cup title in 2006, his very first year with the Syndicate, to grabbing hold of the Rainbow Jersey in 2009 and now aiding and paving the way for the future, each Sunday I will be sharing some of those split seconds in time here. The highs, the lows, the grit and glory with some behind the scenes tech and story.

Greg Minnaar and Fort William are two downhill icons that have truly stood the test of time. As permanent stop on the World Cup circuit since 2002, Greg‚Äôs grabbed 11 podiums and a record breaking 7 wins here, 6 of them on board the Syndicate powered V10. You could say it‚Äôs a match made in heaven even though it feels more like hell out there at times.
-
Whipping wind, rain, sleet and hail on the upper reaches leaves you exposed with nowhere to hide, Greg is one of the best at carrying speed here. Before you can find shelter in the midge infested woods you have to navigate the fastest and longest bedrock section on any World Cup track. Greg's lankiness and ability to find the smoothest lines, combined with the V10‚Äôs extra travel is hard to match here. It‚Äôs a roll of the dice on how the woods are taped, one of the few bits of track to change each year. Then it‚Äôs the drag race down the motorway powering and tucking over the jumps (Greg's speciality) before being welcomed by the biggest and loudest crowd gathered in any finish arena come rain or shine each year. It‚Äôs one of the only venues where I still get goosebumps when it comes down to the final few riders. Something everyone needs to experience at least once. A gathering of clans for the mountain bike fans.
-
The loudest cheers are usually reserved for hometown heroes and royalty (Peaty), Minnaar is one of the few outlanders who brings them to their feet. Ever since embarking on his racing career based in the UK, he has a special affinity with the British fans who have welcomed him as their own. After recently pledging allegiance to the Queen and receiving a British passport, the question is who will receive knighthood first, Greg or Steve?

Young blood, but old hands. Loris & Luca have followed similar trajectories and near parallel career paths during their early years of World Cup racing. In 2014, both juniors, they are neck on neck, trading wins, two a piece and it‚Äôs a battle right to the end of the season, finishing 1st & 2nd respectively. Grabbing top tens finishes (a podium for Loris) as rookie Elites they both further cement themselves into the top ten with podiums in their 2nd year.
-
Both have loving and supporting families with cycling in their veins, Claude Vergier battles Bruni senior at Masters Worlds mirroring the ongoing battle between their respective offspring in the majors, While Doug Shaw goes about nabbing all the major Cols in Europe as Luca tackles the rough downhills tracks.
-
In 2017 they are both conscripted into the Syndicate. Collectively they bring down the average age of the team significantly. The move is genius not only is the future bright for the Syndicate but the challenge of youth re-ignites a fire within Minnaar and he goes on a stormer proving there‚Äôs still plenty of bite left in the top dog. With big shoes to fill and no doubt some weighty expectations on their shoulders they waste no time in turning heads. All eyes are on them at the season opener, new year, new team, new bike and new BIG wheel size. Luca and Loris go one and three in qualifying, they have arrived!
-
A couple of years of highs and lows for both of them, a slew of wins in qualifying and some frustrating crashes. Bad luck with niggling injuries they still push relentlessly, already podium proven they are now both after the win. It comes first for Loris, bittersweet watching from the hot seat as teammate, number one qualifier and last man down, Luca crashes out in Andorra. Loris is buoyed on by another duo of French Revolutionaries and more podiums soon follow. Luca grabs a couple but will no doubt be wanting to balance the scales more evenly once again and bring his version of the Red White and Blue onto the top step. I can‚Äôt wait to see how their intertwined story continues to develop when we head out healthy and ready to race again.

2020 marks @KathySessler‚Äôs 17th year at the helm of The Syndicate.
In all that time there have only ever been 6 team riders, so clearly she is doing something right. When riders sign, they become part of the family. It can be no easy task dealing with a team of such individual and larger than life characters. No doubt her past experience as a bike-riding stunt women comes in handy keeping them all in check. Then as a past successful racer herself, she knows what a rider needs to do their best. With top ten World Cup DH results and a masters World Champs in the 90‚Äôs she almost matches her riders resumes, earning her nickname ‚ÄúOne Fast Mother‚Äù
‚Ä¢
Taking on a lot more than just cooking and booking she invests herself emotionally with the team too. She‚Äôs handy with the camera, puts out sponsor books, hosts a mid season team Christmas dinner with presents and all, she keeps them distracted when they need it and focussed when it‚Äôs time to perform. On race day there is always hidden Champagne on ice in the pits in case one of her boys win, but she will just as graciously gift it to another team with a winning rider. True class!
‚Ä¢
It‚Äôs very much a two way relationship and her boys have been showing their appreciation by gifting her a unique charm to fill a very special bracelet she began building in 2008. Each win, big result or special milestone is recorded with the appropriate keepsake of gold, silver, diamonds, sapphires, onyx, wood and Murano glass. 
Roskopp, Bryceland, Peaty and Minnaar all filling one in four short years. The second edition is already in the making, we hope you have room on your wrist for many more‚Ä¶ We love you Kathy.

Santa Cruz is a company of people brought together by a love of bicycles.
But bikes aren‚Äôt everything.
‚Ä¢
We‚Äôre deeply saddened and troubled by the events surrounding George Floyd‚Äôs death, and it‚Äôs plain to see the societal wounds it‚Äôs torn open.
‚Ä¢
One of our core beliefs is that bikes can be used as a force for good. We don‚Äôt just believe in quality bicycles, we believe in quality of life.
What does that mean? We work hard to find good things we can do in our communities and invest our time, sweat, and dollars to make it happen.
‚Ä¢
How do we, as a bike company, positively impact racial injustice and inequality?
Posting on social media‚Äôs not going to solve it, but we want to make sure our employees, athletes, and customers of color know that we support them and have their backs.
We want equality for all people, and we want justice brought to those assholes who deserve it.
‚Ä¢
We know the world can be better, and we‚Äôre going to be part of making that happen.

If there‚Äôs somebody who has seen & done it all in racing; its Doug ‚ÄúHattrick‚Äù Hatfield. Tuning and tweaking on bikes is part of his DNA, from building his first MTB in the 70‚Äôs (before you could buy them) while still in high school, to working as a full time tech for the US National and Olympic team in the early nineties before moving on to big factory race teams. He‚Äôs worked in road, track, XC, trials & CX before joining Santa Cruz in 2002 and has been heading up Syndicate‚Äôs team support since 2006. During that time he‚Äôs wrenched for every single rider that‚Äôs worn the syndicate stripes, forever the constant & always with a smile and positive infectious attitude that lightens up the pits.
-
There are little tricks, secrets & personal touches that every good mechanic has up their sleeve, but few exude a peaceful, caring & calming aura like Dougie Fresh. I‚Äôve witnessed Minnaar make a last minute decision, while sat in a wet Fort William start gate, to back his pedal pins out a turn for a little extra grip. Doug without panic or fluster magically produces the correct allen and gets the job done with seconds to spare. He‚Äôs that rock you want in your corner.
-
He will build the perfect wheel in under 20 minutes but he will go the extra mile to break in a fresh set of bearings too. Run in bearings roll faster and you can sometimes spot him spinning out the bearings with a high speed drill to conjure up those few extra milliseconds for his rider.  Sometimes there‚Äôs a personal message or an old lucky number board hidden behind the current one, or a fun custom sticker lurking somewhere on the frame that makes all the difference. Experienced hands, some zen wisdom and a stoked happy rider make for a winning package.
-
After thirty years of wrenching Dougie returns for another year as Service Course Manager, a full time job staying on top of the mundane (parts and spares, forecasting, ordering & packing) while still bringing the magic with his forever youthful spark and enthusiasm.

Everyone‚Äôs listened to vinyl records right? You are either old enough that it was part of your youth or young enough that it‚Äôs now the hipster thing to do. Growing up I always had an appreciation & fascination for the B sides. They were the meat & potatoes of an album, often featuring the experimental musical wanderings. The A-Side hits got the attention, radio play & paid the bills, but it was the blue collar B sides that would define a band.
-
This post is dedicated to these unsung heros. The B siders, working hard behind the scenes, night & day, early till late. The job is never done nor clearly defined. Despite what their titles & job descriptions suggest the use of their respective tools of the trade is often the easiest & least important ingredient to the Syndicates success. They bring years of knowledge, experience, wisdom & sometimes just rock solid, quick thinking Kiwi ingenuity to the table. I present you Marshy, Laura, PA, Jordi and Joe.
-
Marshy may appear gruff & gritty on the outside but has the biggest heart. When he‚Äôs not puzzling with Greg or inventing products, he‚Äôs quietly helping out desperate deserving privateers on the side.
-
Laura has the magic healing hands and always knows what the riders need. Rehab, pre race warm ups or post race recovery she keeps them finely tuned.
-
PA was already quite the seasoned traveller & mechanic before he joined the Syndicate to work with fellow Frenchman. Together with Loris they have brainstormed & tested some wild ideas and concepts. Neither afraid to break new ground.
-
Fox‚Äôs Jordi, is pretty much family. The yin to Gregs & Loris‚Äô yang. His perpetual patience and  generous sharing of (after hours) cocktails or home-brew make him welcome in the pits anytime.
-
Joe Bowman, has his finger on the pulse and ultimately is the one that makes the boys all look good. Also current reigning Media World Champion.
-
All of the above living proof that every now and then, like Queen‚Äôs We Will Rock You there‚Äôs a sleeper hit hiding on the B side.

If it wasn‚Äôt for Dirt Magazine I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am now. Simple as that. Before Dirt entered my life, I was a full time skateboarder and undercover mountain biker. MTB was my dirty secret that I hid from my skateboarding brethren, it just wasn‚Äôt cool. Then in the early 2000‚Äôs I happened across a copy of Dirt Magazine, an eye opening revelation in stark contrast to the existing mainstream. A whole new subculture & lifestyle celebrating individuality, performance & style. Cutting edge photography paired with frenetic design & clean layouts of creative chaos. Bikes were passports to pleasure, from dreamy alpine road trips to dark wet pub ride frenzies but it was the rarefied & glorified world of downhill racing that was celebrated most & held in highest regard. I was hooked. It‚Äôs hard to convey just how much influence, pull & power Dirt had, gracing its pages was an honour & covers were lusted & fought over if you were a rider or photographer.
-
Come end of year it was an almost sure bet the it would go to the most deserving or break out rider that year. In 2008 that man of the moment was Greg Minnaar. With the World Cup Series wrapped up only four days prior in a wet Schladming, we now found ourselves in polar opposite conditions under the scorching sun of Las Vegas trying to deliver an eye catching cover commissioned by the ever particular Dirt editor/visionary Mike Rose. AKA god.
-
Greg, still jet lagged & hung over from trans-Atlantic celebrations, arrived with no riding kit other than helmet & goggles & his bike still had spikes on, an incongruent anomaly here in the desert. Combined with the ever present Inter-bike distractions, I had my work cut out.
-
Luckily I had the ‚Äúend of year Dirt cover shot‚Äù cheat sheet up my sleeve. I knew Mike was a sucker for the ‚Äúblue sky, dry dirt shot‚Äù since this issue would hit the shelves during the dark gloomy days of the British winter & I already knew of a zone where I had shot Steve Peat  carving a turn two years earlier that made the cover. After a couple of turns and only two jumps I knew we had captured something special & perfect for a cover.

When I was a kid my dad used to take me to watch cricket. Now cricket is nothing like baseball. It drags on for five days and sometimes even then there is no winner. What I remember most from those long hot days under the sun was that the fans were often more interesting than the game itself especially in the afternoons when the beers had been flowing for a few hours, giving the streakers the dutch courage needed to liven up the game a little.
While cricket and DH Racing are polar opposites the spirit of the fans remains the same.
-
Being a true fan is a proper sport in itself and one that can be every bit as serious as the racing it follows. Big crowds and loud fans can transform a good World Cup into a great one come finals day. The deafening electrifying atmosphere in the finish bowl gives me goosebumps, elevating my heart rate and raising the hair on my arms, my own endomorphic spike raising the stakes that much more and only ever felt on finals day at a select few races.
-
Fort William is legendary for its fan turnout and their dedicated passion, no matter what the weather. They will walk the track from top to bottom dressed in all sorts of outfits each year waving sharpie scrawled cardboard signs professing their loyalty to their favourite riders in some fitting and witty way Other iconic venues like Mt St Anne, Val Di Sole, Andorra, Lenzerheide and Leogang all have sardine filled finish areas and the French fans, well they are hard to beat, they are as crazy about cycling as they are over the Syndicate. The Aussie fans are there for the party and will bury beer and Bundy filled eskies weeks before a venue is fenced off. South Africa fields a loud, large and dedicated One Life Crew, cursedly armed with vuvuzelas, that will mysteriously  pop up on the other side of the world en masse whenever Greg wins a race. Then there is a long time Syndicate fan who is so committedly all in that he has to go by the pseudonym ‚ÄúIvan‚Äù to protect his real identity.
-
Without the fans racing is simply not the same. Hopefully I have more than cricket to look forward to in the near future.

In the 80‚Äôs every skateboarder's dream was to move to California, get sponsored and turn pro. It was my dream and it was Rob Roskopp‚Äôs dream. Dreams we were both able to fulfill, albeit with different degrees of success; Rob had one of the all-time best selling skate decks, while I was eating 2-minute noodles & hitchhiking around California, living the dream.
As fate would have it, our paths briefly crossed one night in 1992 at a downtown San Jose skate park. 10 years older than me, Rob was already hooked on bikes and in the planning stages with Santa Cruz Bicycles, which he launched soon after. Star struck then, it took me another 10 years before I found bikes and as they say, the rest is history.
‚Ä¢
The point of my story is that the roots run deep with both Santa Cruz and The Syndicate. It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint exactly what makes both so successful, but it is certainly more than just the sum of the parts. Wild, all risking rebellious abandon juxtaposed with savant-like determination, practice and perfection. All traits & pathways to success, be it in skateboarding, running a company, or becoming a top downhill racer. Rob has built more than a brand, he has built a family and a following.
‚Ä¢
I figured out pretty early on with The Syndicate any conundrum can be overcome by either a statement or a question - It‚Äôs either a DTR ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell Rob‚Äù when maybe a rental car gets damaged, or WWRD ‚ÄúWhat would Rob do?‚Äù when you are wondering whether to splash out on another round of celebratory drinks on the team credit card.
‚Ä¢
What I have seen most since I‚Äôve got to know Rob better, is that The Syndicate is more than a line item to him. It‚Äôs his love & his family. His heart and soul are fully invested. Never resting, even when winning, he‚Äôs the driving force in R&D in the off season, and when racings back on you will find him in the mud trackside during training. Then getting the party started in the pits when there‚Äôs celebrating to be done.
‚Ä¢
Having roots in skateboarding doesn‚Äôt automatically buy you street cred, but it sure does rub off when building one of the most iconic bike racing teams in history - The Syndicate.

The first time I shot Fort William was also the last time I raced there. It was the 2007 World Champs and I was racing for South Africa.
Managing & riding for a team with a tight budget meant I had to have side jobs to fund the dream. I was just starting to shoot for a few mags, but since I was also racing I had no real clients. Somehow I managed to hustle shooting Worlds for Decline Magazine. I sold my concept to editor Scott Hart, that the whole feature should only focus on the action & emotions from in & around the finish area on race day.
I never told him that the real reason was because I had to be on my bike, practicing & racing during the rest of the week.
I did my run, then quickly grabbed my gear, and proceeded to shoot the fast guys who came down last. Job done!
‚Ä¢
Twelve years on, and it‚Äôs still largely the finish area photos that matter most at Ft William. From the roar of the crowd when the racers launch into view through the VISIT SCOTLAND arch until they cross the finish line, the amount of iconic shots on offer for a quick thinking, quicker moving photographer is unrivaled by any other World Cup stop. Racing photography is all about telling the day's story, complimenting the venues vibe and capturing the nail biting action. And you never know who is going to win until the final rider crosses the line. With a 3 rider team I try to mix it up to offer some variety, but moving anywhere in the finish arena that‚Äôs packed with rowdy fans and only 3+ minutes between riders.
The best, and most fitting way to to describe it would be choreographed chaos. It can be a gamble, but I‚Äôve learned to trust my gut instinct. And if all else fails, and you end up stuck in no-mans-land, I pray and trust that my pre-set remote cameras will save the day.
‚Ä¢
I have to admit that after that busy day in 2007 I left Scotland more excited with my photos than by my race results, and without realizing it at the time, it was to be my final big UCI DH race behind the bars. From 2008 onwards I became a full-time photographer. One who is lucky enough to still get that race day fix of endorphins pumping through my veins.

Outside the tape. 
‚Ä¢
While the list of Syndicate titles, championships & accolades is a long one, what makes them so successful is that they know how to find a balance both during & after the race season. Mental & physical stresses can easily take their toll during the yearly cycle & they know a bow that is too tightly strung is all too easily broken, so distractions are both sought & needed.
With their reputation you wouldn‚Äôt be far off the mark in assuming that this would manifest itself in a couple of rounds of beers, or bottles of wine. That goes without saying, but they are, thankfully, more multidimensional than that.
‚Ä¢
From the beginning Steve has always been the peoples champ, and that didn‚Äôt change when he finally became the World Champ. Alongside various business endeavours he‚Äôs always made a point of spreading the joys of riding world wide and is only too happy to give back to his local community as well.
‚Ä¢
Greg is a gifted and multi-talented sportsman. Golf, moto, surfing and cliff diving, he does it all.  He‚Äôs also the first to open the wine after track walk day.
‚Ä¢
Josh loves to ride and loves to get naked,. Sometimes both at the same time. Any bike, any place, any time. He didn‚Äôt need a sculpted or manicured bike park, just some good beats and irie vibes.
‚Ä¢
Loris leads a mysterious double life, he‚Äôs managed to stealthily train for his secret passion of enduro despite being feverishly courted by the French fashion houses. Eschewing their inevitable grasp for one more season.
‚Ä¢
Despite his youth, Luca‚Äôs Zen wisdom runs deep, he‚Äôs always marched to his own beat. When he‚Äôs outside the tape on Sundays there's a good chance you can find him watching and supporting his better-half inside the tape, needless to say he spends more time on his XC bike these days even though he doesn‚Äôt ride it like one.
‚Ä¢
But it was Kirt Voreis, one of the Syndicate original members who first figured out the importance of balance and life beyond the tape. Pioneering new professional paths simply by following his passions. We love you Kirt, don‚Äôt ever change.

A tall, wise man from Sheffield once said, ‚ÄúWin or lose, we on the booze.‚Äù While it may have been slurred in an earlier era; long before coaches, road bike intervals, go pros, nutritionists & trainers changed the face of DH racing, it still holds mostly true today.
‚Ä¢
We‚Äôve already glorified & celebrated the many Syndicate victories in this series but as I‚Äôve priorly postulated, the universe always ensures a degree of balance. The Jedi Knights wouldn‚Äôt be so venerated without the Sith Lords. Even our Syndicate Jedi‚Äôs take their knocks from time to time & a few battles are lost along the way and sorrows drowned overnight.
‚Ä¢
I‚Äôve seen Steve so bruised & battered, barely able to hobble yet still throws his leg over his bike and sails down the course. It‚Äôs the getting back up that counts. His biopic fittingly titled ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt Back Down‚Äù & by now we‚Äôve all become accustomed to him sinking a few Stellas along the way.
‚Ä¢
Bryceland has had his fair share of hard knocks. Going for broke, literally, on more than one occasion. You would think he would have learnt his YOLO lesson as junior in the infamous Maribor rock garden but in true Ratboy fashion he never changed his riding or approach to life, even when ahead in the biggest race of the year. God Bless The Rat.
‚Ä¢
I‚Äôve witnessed Minnaar dislocate his shoulder entering the Mont St Anne rock garden, carry on & pop his shoulder back in on the exit out. Insane.
But what will forever remain burnt in both my sensor and memory banks is his spectacular crash in Val Di Sole where he folded both himself & bike around a solid pole at near terminal velocity, casually walk it off & after a full bike rebuild still qualify 2nd. Nerves of steel that man & an appetite & instigator when it comes to the liquid gold. He might have even lost his bike once in a French farmers field, never to be found again but that is another story.
‚Ä¢
Loris and Luca both hail from the new school of professional athletes & as such failure usually fuels more stringent training, analysis followed up by a punishing hot road climb or workout, but thankfully even they too let their hair down in true Syndicate spirit now and again.

Fly On The Wall
‚Ä¢
Many of my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù friends often ask me how much longer am I going to keep doing this; Leaving home, living out of a bag for seven months each year just to photograph other people racing bikes. On the surface that is a pretty valid question, my response mirrors the cliched Confucius quote, ‚ÄúChoose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.‚Äù
Confucius obviously never had to try to find working internet in Scotland at 3am, never spilled a beer onto his MacBook at midnight & never had to fly around the world with his whole life in two overweight bags, but he was definitely on to something. I‚Äôve been shooting World Cup racing for just over thirteen years now but luckily as a photographer every day offers something new, even at some of the tired old repeat venues. I‚Äôm out in nature with fresh mountain air & get to witness & document some of the greatest feats of human coordination, skill, determination & bravery. No two days are alike, no outcomes are predetermined, be it in the weather, light or action. I get to see some amazing things and do my best to document it justly for posterity's sake.
‚Ä¢
There are stories to be told everywhere, sometimes I manufacture and plan shots, like a sneaky pole cam shot intruding on Steve getting rid of his nerves in a bathroom stall moments before his race run up top near the start of Ft William. Other times, moments just present themselves in front of you, like a fox crossing my path while I quietly lie waiting for a shot, or a snake slithering by while I‚Äôm in deep in the bush setting up for a sneaky secret sniper shot. Moments in nature that make you forget you are just at another bike race. Never mind the poor spider covered in neon course marking spray inching its way down the roots that I‚Äôm zoomed in on waiting for a tyre to appear. Old rediscovered shots allow you to relive forgotten moments, bring smiles and spark emotions.
Details, stories, angles & emotions, it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a maiden WC win celebration or some bandy legged goon riding, it‚Äôs these fly on the wall moments that keep me coming back each and every year.

Vital MTB Test Sessions: Four Exciting Electric Mountain Bikes Reviewed Head-to-Head.
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúThe Santa Cruz Heckler was hands down the most eager to tackle rowdy sections. It truly stood out with its general braap-ability. It doesn't matter what's in front of you, this bike has it handled. The additional low-central mass of a motor and battery paired with the buttery lower-link VPP suspension blew our minds when changing directions and in various situations of smashing - @vitalmtb‚Äù

My first ever World Cup I raced was Kaprun 2003. It was also the first time I ever raced in the mud, the first time I rode spikes and my qualifying run was the first time I ever used flats (clips simply wouldn‚Äôt work) Hailing from Southern California at the time I had no experience in wet weather conditions. I remember asking Greg Minnaar, who I barely knew at the time, what the trick or technique was, he advised me to ride it like its dry and if I felt it sliding get on the pedals and power down for grip. He placed 2nd in the final, I just qualified and ended up 52nd.
‚Ä¢
For most mere mortals, mud means mayhem but for the cream of the crop, like the Syndicate, they still, somehow, manage to ride it like it‚Äôs dry. While practise, familiarity, tire choice, suspension settings and skilful technique go a long way in making mud manageable it‚Äôs really mental fortitude that allows you to stay off the brakes commit to the big high wet rooty off-camber lines come race day. You either have it or you don‚Äôt.
‚Ä¢
Some tracks benefit from moisture at some point in the week, preferably Thursday or Friday to offer prime racing conditions come Sunday, but then there are those odd occasions when no matter your pedigree when you add ill timed showers to hard pack clay all you are left with is a dice roll and a hail Mary. Lourdes 2017 springs to mind here. Ruts, roots, roll-offs, and raincoats, ironically all regularly feature during the summer European race season. High temperatures & even higher mountains fuel & feed the sudden violent & often recalcitrant thunderstorms.
‚Ä¢
For a photographer it‚Äôs a double edged sword. I love the rain for all its drama, contrast & creativity it brings. Old venues painted with a new patina, vivid saturation, wet rich greens and dark muddy moody contrasts pierced, sliced and spiced with streaking rain are a blessing but when it‚Äôs accompanied by wind or humidity, it quickly turns into an expensive, frustrating, blurry mess of foggy sensors and short circuited systems.
‚Ä¢
What will the return to racing bring? I‚Äôll definitely still be packing the gore tex and brollies, maybe even a snow parka.

Let‚Äôs get one thing straight, Paley isn‚Äôt a mountain biker. He‚Äôs not a BMXer. He‚Äôs a man possessed with the need to just get his kicks and doesn‚Äôt care about the neat little categories other people have made fences around so it‚Äôs easier for them to build divisions of people.
He‚Äôs a biker, but he‚Äôs also a boxer, clean eater, joy bringer, and a vocal supporter for his friends that are doing good things in positive ways. Which is why we are big fans of him.

Sundays With Sven
‚Ä¢
The Syndicate is primarily known as a thoroughbred DH race team, but like most of us they also spend a lot of time on their short travel bikes. They might not admit it but they also love to race a bit of enduro when the seasons schedule allows for it and have competed in a handful of EWS events over the years.
‚Ä¢
Greg, the ever competitive racer didn‚Äôt waste time getting stuck in during the early formative years of the Enduro World Series. The chance to race past nemeses Fabien Barel and Nico Vouilloz again was probably enough to get Minnaar to sign up. In only his second Enduro World Series event he managed to land himself on the Podium in third place alongside fellow World Champions Nico and Graves, proving that should he choose to he could also master this longer more endurance focussed form of gravity racing.
‚Ä¢
Steve gets to spend a lot more time on the ‚Äúshort travel‚Äù bikes these days and can often be seen matching the teams speeds during DH test camps on his enduro bike. During the early days of EWS he too showed his pedigree with some top ten finishes. These days we get to see him truly discover just how far & deep into the backcountry these bikes can take you in the wilder more adventurous enduro races like Trans Provence and the NZ Enduro, where mixing racing with beer stops is encouraged not frowned upon. Perfect for uncle Steve.
‚Ä¢
Having only competed in one EWS event in Finale as a season (B)ender which involved more beer, cappuccinos and gelato than serious effort Luca prefers to keep his focus strictly DH although when he chooses to he‚Äôs a force to be reckoned with, nabbing a Trans Cascadia podium in 2018.
‚Ä¢
Perhaps out of the bunch the one with the biggest Enduro fettish would be our famously fast Frenchie Loris Vergier. As a junior he took a win over the ever dominant Martin Maes then a few more legendary scalps with his Trans Cascadia win. If he didn‚Äôt have such a big future ahead of him in DH the enduro guys would have something to worry about.
‚Ä¢
With the EWS wrapping up this weekend in Finale lets reminisce on some of Syndicates early exploits and dabbling in Enduro World Series racing.

‚Ä¢
I only got to race three World Champs, a flat tire bookended with two (ok three) over the bars summed my worlds experience during my short lived DH ‚Äúcareer‚Äù. However it‚Äôs the memories and immense feeling of pride and patriotism when donning the green and gold ‚Äúbig five animal‚Äù South African Jersey, representing the rainbow nation alongside much more accomplished riders like Anka and Greg Minnaar is something that I‚Äôll cherish forever. They got issued skin suits, but for some reason the federation decided the baggy rugby jersey would better suited to me.
‚Ä¢
While the World Cup series title proves who the best rider is all year, there‚Äôs no denying the allure and pull of the magical rainbow jersey, one only has to look at Steve Peats‚Äôs 17 year quest to appreciate this. In it‚Äôs time the Syndicate has amassed 11 medals, four of them gold and they are just getting warmed up with young fresh talent from the bench now ready to make their own mark in the history books alongside Minnaar who is no doubt looking to snag a few more before he calls it a day, few can raise their game for the big matches like the lanky South Africanüáøüá¶
‚Ä¢
Then there are the kits and matching bikes. The bikes, wow there have been some gems, each year something unique drawing from fresh inspiration and providing that little  extra bit of motivation.  Some years the designs are personal and detailing cryptic and others follow a team theme thread, but it‚Äôs the patriotic ones that do it for me and stand the test of time.
‚Ä¢
It‚Äôs been company tradition that every winning bike ends up in the hands of the sports biggest super fan, none other than our very own Rob Roskopp, so it took a special kind of shell game, bike box switcheroo heist at the Canberra airport for Sir Steve PEAT to retain rightful ownership of his gold winning chariot. Rob had to settle for the replica this time around.
‚Ä¢
What will this years bikes look like? Decals, paint and powder coat, we‚Äôve seen it all. With all three riders ready to give it their all, will Roskopp need to make some more space on his wall?

Last practice before race day. Track was drying out, but with cold temps and whole lot of rain predicted overnight and all day Sunday, it's going to be a wild one.
If they have to cancel racing on Sunday (Unlikely but possible) the Quali results will stand as the finals.
Let‚Äôs hope we have some good racing conditionsü§û

The new mixed wheel Heckler gives the confidence of a 29-inch wheel up front and retains the snappy handling of a 27.5 wheel out back while the full carbon frame, 140mm-travel fork and lower-link VPP rear suspension design makes the bike sit up and sprint.
‚Ä¢
Pair this with the new Shimano EP8 motor that is lighter, more powerful, and more efficient, and we‚Äôve got an ebike that is even more capable of tackling longer, tougher rides.

What's next after you Everest and then climb out of the stratosphere? The tallest plantery mountain in the solar system, that's what.
‚Ä¢
After Everesting a few years back, then climbing and descending 55,000 vertical metres in only 30 days last December, all while holding down his full-time bike-mechanic job at @vertigo_bikes_queenstown, the question many had for @benhildred was what's next?
‚Ä¢
It was his boss, Paul "Pangus" Angus, who suggested Olympus Mons, a volcano on the planet Mars that stands 21,287.4m (69,841ft) above datum, said to be the tallest planetary mountain in the solar system, roughly two and a half times the height of Mt. Everest. After exiting the stratosphere with his last attempt it made sense to continue further out into space to find the next ascent to conquer.
‚Ä¢
The Olympus Mons challenge is simple: Climb at least 21,288m in just 72 hours. Each day must consist of one ride, each ride must be on a different climb and descent loop, but the whole ride has to be completed on the same bike. Ben, being a Queenstown local did the whole thing on a mountain bike (a Tallboy), mostly off-road.
‚Ä¢
In November Ben led the first exhibition to figuratively climb Olympus Mons. For the next three days we'll recap his odyssey here on @santacruzbicycles

‚Ä¢
@benhildred gets a lift off some friendly earthlings among the cold of outer space.
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúBleak, bare, brutal.
Coronet Peak was the location today. 
First lap: snow, hail and freezing temperatures at the top of the trail. I had to look where my feet were as I couldn't feel my pedals. My fingers were long gone. Lap two of the second day was the hardest, most gruelling of the whole campaign, even the ascent in the dark and rain didn't warm me up. It‚Äôs the closest I've ever come to falling asleep at the bars. My 'blinks' were questionable. I found some yellow foam matting used for the ski fields under cover and had a quick nap at the top, it was the comfiest I think I'd ever been. Rolling into the snow to start the descent took next level will power.
‚Ä¢
Lap three I was welcomed midway up the climb by friends, Steve and Gnomes, carrying water bottles, warm drinks and warm smiles. They possessed the enthusiasm I'd forgotten about that morning. I felt alive again, fuelled by their encouragement and fancy English breakfast tea. The sun eventually did come out on day two and it got warm. The trails were busy and the morning, only a few hours before, seemed like a distant memory. Once again I was joined by good sorts for laps up and down, listening to their conversation passed the climbs and the growing monotony.
‚Ä¢
The descent was mainly down ‚ÄòRude Rock‚Äô, a Queenstown classic. I rode it in snow, slop, hero dirt, and dust powder all within a few hours. A hill bomb down the road to finish aided recovery from a well trodden tourist trail, luckily the day before made the knuckle tearing more tolerable. Rubbing Deep Heat between my fingers helped too...‚Äù

Mission: Olympus Mons Day 03 - Mission Critical
Looting Interants and a Return to Home
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúI'd earned a proper night's sleep after the second day ‚Äì a whole seven whole hours. I started later, not on the road until 4am. This was it, only 7200m to go. Only.
‚Ä¢
The temperature change from bottom to the base building of the ski fields was a real wake up call, flashbacks of the day before were filling my head and clouding my defensive wall of positive, determined thoughts. I'd strategically placed my favorite Misspent Summers (very apt) jumper at the bottom as something to look forward to. But it disappeared around lap two, likely pinched by the occupants of an overflowing, shaggy looking campervan, the only people I saw that morning. That frustration got me up lap three.
‚Ä¢
The whole @vertigo_bikes_queenstown crew and friends joined me for the last lap. The weather took an abysmal turn for the worst half way up. We were riding in hail and head winds. The end was in sight but we couldn't see much through the cloud we found ourselves in. Thank you to everyone who came out for laps over the past three days. It really helped.
‚Ä¢
My 72 hours went great. My bike was faultless and my body although exhausted was not devastated. I chose to run the Tallboy for its efficiency, seating position and stability, even when I wasn‚Äôt so stable. Running the effortless and reliable SRAMS AXS groupset gave one less thing to worry about. Coupled with my flat pedals, 34 tooth chainring and lack of chamois I had a winning combo.
‚Ä¢
I can now tick this one off, and more importantly share it with the cycling community. Being the admin of the OlympusMons.cc site I‚Äôm excited to see other efforts. I‚Äôd hope these daft rides inspire some of you to set your own goals. Mountain biking can be gnarly in so many ways, whether for that endorphin or adrenalin buzz. What a sick, sick sport......What‚Äôs next?‚Äù

2020 World Champs & World Cup

While the latest James Bond film continues to be postponed, The Syndicate steps in for your eyes only... filling the void with a new feature length episode.
‚Ä¢
Joe Bowman‚Äôs gold finger has been on the button to capture the World Championships and World Cups from this spectre of a year.
‚Ä¢
Sky fall in the shape of rain and snow meant the Worlds was not enough to satisfy most race fans this season.  Thankfully the team charged into the following races with a view to a kill.  And kill it they did, with Luca returning to form, Loris taking back-to-back wins in Maribor, and Greg taking a 1st and 2nd place in Lousa. Proving you never say never again when it comes to The G.O.A.T.
‚Ä¢
And Peaty? He‚Äôs been like a man on her majesty‚Äôs secret service, gathering intel from every corner of the mountain and feeding it back to the riders to prepare for changing track conditions.  Thanks to all the crew‚Äôs hard work, the Syndicate brought home the #1 team ranking for the year.
‚Ä¢
This latest installment of The Syndicate franchise also marks Loris Vergier‚Äôs final appearance as a Santa Cruz agent.  After four great years together, it‚Äôs time to say au revoir to the self-proclaimed #7.  We‚Äôre proud to have supported Loris‚Äô rise from fast frenchie to World Cup winner and we wish him all the best for the futureüñ§
‚Ä¢
Greg, Luca and Steve all remain on the team for next year along with all our main partners.  You can follow the Santa Cruz Syndicate‚Äôs continuing exploits on the team homepage, Instagram and Youtube.
‚Ä¢
2020 has been an odd year but we leave the races completely stirred, not shaken, and are looking forward to the 2021 season already. So until then, grab a Vesper Martini, tune into the episode and enjoy a Happy Holidays from all of us!

Or sometimes it's old information presented in a new way. It wasn't that I thought I no longer liked 650b wheels, it was simply that I was quite sure I preferred 29. When I became so enamoured with the most recent incarnation of the Santa Cruz Bronson, I wasn't fully aboard the 29er train but since that time I've ridden big wheels almost exclusively, with the odd fat or mullet foray. And I thought I was done. It turns out my my unwritten obituary for anything smaller than 29" wheels was premature...‚Äù

Big mountain riding is a nomadic existence. Meeting friends in farflung car parks. Pinpointing trails you're not sure are even rideable. Sending the ones you know are. Shiny new bling gets battered, shattered and bruised. That‚Äôs life. That‚Äôs how it should be. That's why the Nomad exists.

Our first rule of 2021 was going to be ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk about 2020‚Äù but the truth is, quite a few good things happened along the way, and our Santa Cruz family really came together to battle the avalanche of chaos that pummeled us all year long. 
‚Ä¢
1. @danny_macaskill with the launch of the first Santa Cruz eBike, the new #Heckler‚ö°Ô∏èA lot of excitement and a little controversy ensuedüòâ
‚Ä¢
2. Along with Heckler launch was our first Santa Cruz #PaydirtFund program recipient - @sierratrails for their groundbreaking Connected Communities projectüëä
‚Ä¢
3. @loosedoglewis keeping it cool at the Andes Pacifico, back when we all still thought we‚Äôd be having a ‚Äònormal‚Äô race season. 
‚Ä¢
4. How do you make a bike launch video when you are not allowed to gather a film crew together? The new 5010 launch required us to get creative with our surroundings and turned into what is arguably one of the best MTB oriented short films ever made‚úåÔ∏è
‚Ä¢
5. The @world_enduro season ended up being 2 races in total, and the first inüá®üá≠was a mess of rain, thunderstorms and ‚ùÑÔ∏è 
‚Ä¢
6. Nina Hoffmann takes her first elite World Cup DH win in Maribor! What a run by @nina.hfm96 üôå
‚Ä¢
7. @scsyndicate makes the most of a short but exciting World Cup season by almost winning every race in the series with @lorisvergier 1st in both races in Maribor and @gregminnaar winning race 1 & just barely edged out in race 2 in Portugal. The Syndicate also won the @uci_mountainbike DH Team OverallüèÜNot bad for a season that was in danger of not happening at all.
‚Ä¢
8. The launch of the new #Bullit‚ö°Ô∏èwith speedruns and sound effects by @lorisvergierüó£
‚Ä¢
9. When ‚ÄòEveresting‚Äô became a pandemic pastime for solo cyclists looking to complete a personal challenge, @benhildred significantly raised the bar with his olympusmons.cc project to climb the equivalent of the height of the tallest mountain in our solar system, and rode his Santa Cruz Tallboy 21,635 Meters (70,980ft) in 3 daysü§Ø

Santa Cruz PayDirt Fund Profile - Ridgeline‚Äôs Garfagnana Bike Project
‚Ä¢
Rich & Sandra are joint founders and owners of Ridgeline, which is a mountain bike holiday company operating and based out in the Northern Tuscany region in a place called the Garfagnana. (Pronounced: Gar-fan-yaa-na!).
‚Ä¢
They set up Ridgeline back in 2015 as an escape from the corporate rat race in England and Germany and had the shared dream of having the adventure of setting up a totally new MTB destination from scratch in an relatively unknown part of the world.
‚Ä¢
Sandra and Rich spent years pouring over maps to find our untouched white spot with the perfect mountains and where no one else was operating. And six years later here they are with about 250km of trail network created, including 98km of hand-built tracks, an incredible team, and amazing guests that return year-after-year.

One of the things we look forward to at the end of each year is the Chris King Open House.
We build new bikes, with the about-to-be-launched @chriskingbuzz limited edition colors, then head to Portland Oregon to talk about bikes & bike advocacy, ride bikes, drink a beer or two¬† in Chris's barn, then show our bikes off at the public open house day at the Chris King factory. 
It's a damn good time with a lot of good people.
As you may have noticed, this was not a typical year so getting together in person was not in the cards but CK still managed to put on a show (check it out at chrisking.com) and launch some new colors which leads to this sweet build you see here.

The Beta Tests: Santa Cruz Nomad X01 CC
‚Ä¢
New Nomad review from the new @BetaMTB crew:
‚ÄúThe Santa Cruz Nomad is its own animal, never really feeling like its goal is to go head-to-head with the more race-ready rigs in the test, but rather do the opposite. It offers a distinctly different ride quality, aiming at creativity over speed and encouraging pop over planted-ness. It got one tester rethinking the one-bike quiver that modern design and technology have finally made possible. The new Nomad offers so much pure fun that it doesn‚Äôt feel like it would be redundant in any garage. Just different in the best kind of way...‚Äù

Luke Cryer defines style at speed. He came from the world of gate starts and elbows, even winning silver & bronze medals at the 2015/2016 4X World Championships. Now it‚Äôs the thrill of pitching himself against himself that holds most worth.
‚Ä¢
In 2020 Luke was looking for a new bike and hit up Josh @loosedoglewis seeing if he had any leads on something brand new or second-hand.
Loose Dog lives the mantra of ‚Äúpay it forward‚Äù and has been passing along his old bikes to friends and helping talented friends get setup with bikes through his sponsors for a while. Loose managed to get his hands on a bike wasn‚Äôt being used and it became Luke‚Äôs new ride.
And this is what he does with it.
‚Ä¢
It‚Äôs good to get something new, but if a bike is built to last then there‚Äôs no reason it can‚Äôt have many lives. Santa Cruz builds quality bikes that can take a beating and kept running for many lifetimes. Pay it forward.

Fastest Known Time on the White Rim Trail
‚Ä¢
The newly assembled Santa Cruz htSQD loaded their bikes in the van and headed to Moab to attempt to grab the fastest known time on the White Rim Trail, 100 miles of dusty, wind-battered off-road trail in Canyonlands National Park.
Aboard for the ride were Keegan Swenson, Alexis Skarda & Tobin Ortenblad - A team of individuals with an XC addiction.
‚Ä¢
Keegan and Alexis have been down this road before, as they are both former FKT/WRT record holders before having their respective times bested in 2020.
Tobin decided to make an attempt at the FKT for the clockwise direction, which is the opposite of the traditional route. 
‚Ä¢
7 hrs later ALL were successful:
Keegan's time - 5:28:17 *New FKT - Just 6 seconds faster than the previous record.
Alexis' time - 6:52:55 *New Women‚Äôs FKT - 4 minutes and 5 seconds faster than the previous record.¬†
Tobin's time - 6:16:38 - *New FKT for the clockwise direction.

‚Ä¢
Tobin:
There's really nothing¬†special to my playlist. Double¬†kick drums and some screaming always get me pumped. Most of the music on there would make my mom think there's something wrong with me, which is pretty much on par for a 100-mile all-out effort.
Hit shuffle and let it rip!
‚Ä¢
Alexis:
These are some of¬†my favorite tunes from my high school years. It's mostly a mix of fun music that puts me in a positive mindset mixed with some faster tunes to¬†get me pumped and keep me entertained throughout arduous efforts. There are some guilty pleasures,¬†but who doesn't have those?!
‚Ä¢
Keegan:
Metal and punk rock always gets me fired up to stomp on the pedals, it's my go-to for hard training days and pre-race warm-ups. Every once in a¬†while¬†certain songs would play during the FKT and I'd have to remind myself to turn it down a bit on the pacing to avoid going too deep and risk blowing up.

Great edit from Alexis Skarda‚Äôs 100 mile FKT chasing run at The White Rim Trail.
‚Ä¢
Alexis was a previous owner of the fastest known time on the WRT, and the first women to break the 7hr mark, only to have her record beaten by 16 seconds just a month later.
‚Ä¢
As you might guess, this motivated Alexis to go home, train harder, then come back and take another shot. This time with her new #htSQD teammates in tow.

Nomadic Weekend Away 2021
‚Ä¢
More than 50 riders joined @jamienicolladventures for his annual #NomadicWeekendAway at That Place MTB Park about 20 kms outside of  Whanganui on the North Island of New Zealand.
‚Ä¢
Jamie loaded up his 1960 Bedford bus and provided the campsites, daily ride-outs, camp-side beers, a nomadic style dinner, nightly slide shows, and more.
‚Ä¢
Built on 50 Hectares of Oskam Family trust land, That Place is run by Tom Oskam and Michaella ‚ÄòMac‚Äô Laird and boasts 9 tracks with more being built.
‚Ä¢
Pretty much sounds like an MTB dream right now as most of us are closing in on a full year of restricted travel and very small friend and family circles. Can‚Äôt wait to get back to the good times‚Ä¶

Santa Cruz Bullit - Best In Class - 2021 @theloamwolf eBike shootoutüí•

‚ÄúThe Best in Class winner is the bike that has the absolute best performance up and down the trail, that our riders want to keep for themselves...when our testers focused on which Enduro eBike  they wanted to take home with them, most of us agreed that the Santa Cruz Bullit was the one. It absolutely shreds downhills, is fun to ride, inspires you to push hard, up and down hill, and has a feel that eliminates that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on an eBike‚Äù feeling‚Äù

Ep. 4 Tenerife
‚Ä¢
Video link in bioüëÜ
‚Ä¢
Fun Facts: 
Tenerife is basically a massive volcano that rises up out of the Atlantic Ocean. Pico del Teide is 3715 meters high, making it the tallest mountain in Spain, and the perfect trap for storms traveling across the Atlantic. A lot of those clouds get stuck halfway up the mountain creating a ring of green, lush forests around the island. Usually those storms bring rain to the north side, forming jungle like thick rainforests while they keep the South dry and almost desert-like.
With this, there is every type of riding you could ask for, all packed in one little island. Slippery tight tracks in the north jungle, grippy and loamy trails halfway up the mountain, dry and rocky terrain in the south and loose volcanic dirt at the top of Teide mountain.
In one run from the top you can hit at least three different eco systems and track types.

The New Bronson

Why‚Äôd we mix it up?
If you value style at speed or want to have fun feeling fast, then mixed wheels - 29‚Äù up front, 27.5‚Äù out back - are a great way to get there.
The larger front wheel provides more traction and stability that will make you feel more confident squaring off the turns and diving for the inside lines. But a 27.5-inch tire in the rear means this bike still loves getting up on the back wheel and into the air.

So basically, the mixed wheel setup retains the Bronson's whippable character but the gives the bike added traction and stability for hard hitting riding.

THE SYNDICATE - Les Gets Finals
It was building up to be an epic race on an epic new DH course in Les Gets when it all went sideways as the rain came in and turned the already gnarly track into a battle of survival at speed.
‚Ä¢
Greg was up first and turned in a great run slotting into 7th on an increasingly slick track.
In fact, no one in the top 12 that followed him could go any faster, and his 7th place time held up to the finish.
‚Ä¢
Luca followed right after Greg‚Äôs run and knew he‚Äôd need to push the limits to get as good of a time that was possible on a dryer track earlier in the day, so Luca found that limit‚Ä¶then went past it, crashing in a spot that caused a lot of problems for others.

After a great start on Friday night with @mctubbbin winning the Crit-Cross raceü•á, the guys were looking for some top results in Sunday‚Äôs 132 mile course with a mix of pavement and gravel and over 11,000 feet of climbing.
@keegels99 was up front and feeling good at 90miles in, then went down hard on a fast gravel descent.
After gathering himself back up and straightening out his bars and fixings his chain, Keegan charged back to finish in the top 10 overall üí™
Then Keegan got to celebrate by going back to the van to scrub the dirt & grime from his road rash‚Ä¶

Ben Hildred Rides One Million Vertical Feet in 200 Daysüîù
‚Ä¢
You might remember @benhildred from his insane ‚ÄòEveresting‚Äô one-up, the Olympus Mons challenge of climbing the equivalent height of the tallest mountain in the solar system (2.5 times taller than Everest) in 72hrs. We believe Ben is still the only one to complete this challenge (details at olympusmons.cc)
‚Ä¢
This time around Ben set out to do something a few others have already done, which is to climb and descend 1,000,000 vertical feet in one year. 
But then Ben decided to one-up that as well by completing it in only 200 days, averaging 5,000 feet (1524m) a day over the course of the challenge. ü§Ø

Greg was struggling early in the week with some lingering back issues, then had a race run where nothing went right for the new World Champ, eventually finishing P19. 
Luca has a mishap that launched him off the bike and onto his back in the rocks. Very thankfully it looks like no major injuries and he has a bit of time to heal up before the country roads take him home to the 2 race back-to-back season finale In Snowshoe, West Virginia üá∫üá∏

Further - The Yes Generation - @shimanomtb

The US MTB trail-building scene always needs more champions, and John Groom and his coworkers at the @u.s.forestservice Truckee Ranger District are a great example.
‚Ä¢
Groom is among a new, younger generation of Forest Service officers with a vested interest in new trail construction. In an agency tasked with huge responsibilities, from fire management to watershed restoration, recreation within the Forest Service has historically sat on the back burner. However, Groom prioritizes recreation, saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù to public desires for more trails, and he works to provide more recreational opportunities.

Mayhem on the Mountain - Snowshoe World Cup DH 1

For the most part things did not go according to plan for race #1 of 2 for the @scsyndicate and @nina.hfm96.
‚Ä¢
Even though he‚Äôs nursing a separated shoulder, @gregminnaar decided to suit up anyway and see if he could manage a run in practice, but that quickly turned into a big ‚ÄòNope‚Äô. Now he‚Äôll save his energy to try and take another run at it for race 2 on Saturday.
‚Ä¢
Although @luca_shaw has a chipped bone in his wrist, he had a great 3rd place quali run and was poised to make some noise in the finals. His race run went fast and smooth, but not as fast as he had hoped, ending up 18th. Definitely will be looking for some redemption in race 2 if he can keep the wrist pain managed.

A tech video on a tubeless valve?! Trust us, you are going to want to check this one out - The new Fillmore valve by @reservewheels
‚Ä¢
Our friends over at Reserve are rewriting the future of tubeless systems with the introduction of their new Fillmore valve, a completely new take on tubeless valve designs. 
The patented Reserve Fillmore valve represents a leap forward in technology, with a design that eliminates the traditional, delicate, clog-inciting presta valve core of yesteryear. 
‚Ä¢
Features:
- High Flow: 3X air flow makes seating tires a snap
- No Clog: Patented poppet-style design eliminates clogging by shielding air hole from contact with sealant
- Direct-Inject: Coreless design for no-fuss injection of sealant
- Micro-Adjust: Airs down to the perfectly dialed tire pressure

Old Enough To Know Better | Rab Wardell | Ep. 1 
‚Ä¢
@rabwardell is striving, fighting, and living his life full of fire and joy. His dreams are still bright, and at 36 his desire to compete at the highest level, and be the best athlete he can be, is a chance for all of us to analyze if we should ever be "old enough to know better‚Äù
‚Ä¢
In the first episode of this four-part series, Rab takes a look back at where it all began, in the foothills of Fife, through to the crushing disappointment of the 2006 commonwealth games, and how that has led to where he is now, including his FKT on the West Highland way in 2020. He begins to ask the question, at 36, should he know better than to risk reliving past pains, or is chasing dreams always worthwhile?

@pinkbike Field Test: 2022 Santa Cruz Blur TR - The Cruz Missile
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúSanta Cruz‚Äôs new Superlight design might look similar to previous versions of VPP but it is very different. It uses a flex pivot in the rear and this means it can go without the associated weight gain that comes with a standard pivot.

The consequence is that, in terms of all-out seat grip, Santa Cruz may have just played a masterstroke. Whereas every new bike release seems to include claims of an increase in anti-squat, Santa Cruz has actually reduced this value on the Blur, as well as tuning the linkage to require a lower spring rate. We‚Äôll come back to this and its ramifications later in the climbing section, but in short, it delivers on its promise.‚Äù

One year down, more to come - #htSQD
Five years ago @luca_shaw suited up in his first kit for The Syndicate, a school gym outfit for the infamous 2017 team launch video. And the good times rolled on from there.

Five race seasons later, Luca has pulled on dozens of @scsyndicate race kits, ridden thousands of miles, sprayed gallons¬†of champagne, eaten mountains of @wafflehouseofficial and shared countless hugs and high-fives with his teammates, friends and fans. Syndicate University (#fiveyearplan) has taught him well, and now Luca is ready to roll on to what's next.

So 'tis the season to be jolly stoked about all the good times we've had together.
On behalf of Santa Cruz, the Syndicate and all our partners, we are wishing him the best of luck in his new ventures next season.

Luca, our pit is always open to ya' buddy... you know where we hide the key!üñ§

This is it. Starting back with his West Highland Way FKT, @rabwardell has now been on an 18 month journey. What started as an idea, and went through various iterations of a fragile reality, has now become a very lucid reality.
Rab will take to the start the line in Plymouth, on a course steeped in UK cycling folklore, against the best the nation has to offer. As the pressure mounts, it‚Äôs important to remember that this a choice, and no matter the outcome, Rab is slowly proving to himself, and others, that dreams, in all their unfiltered chaos, are there to be chased.

Jackson Goldstone (CAN): the current Junior World Champion probably still gets jigsaws for his birthday, but Jackson turns 18 this year and is poised to throw a whole box of firecrackers into the Elite ranks in 2023. Until then, Steve and Greg are mentoring the former ‚ÄúSuper Grom‚Äù through another junior season, in preparation for that leap into primetime.

#LetTheHecklingBegin
@Danny_MacAskill 
just goes on and on and on and on...
‚Ä¢
Danny doesn't stop talking about ebikes. He's infatuated with them.  In fact, the only time he's not chewing someone's ear off about how ‚Äúmint‚Äù they are is when he's riding one. And when he's riding his ebike he just rides and rides and rides. Which is why we've equipped the newest Heckler to venture further and faster, for longer.
‚Ä¢
150mm of efficient VPP suspension matched to a 720wh battery is a potent combo that makes all-day odysseys feel like a Wee Day Out. The interchangeable battery system also means you need never resort to catching a Highland locomotive home either. Just swap out your battery on the trail and keep rolling.
‚Ä¢
But with great power comes great responsibility. The Heckler gets Danny so far out that we have a duty to ensure he makes it back too. This bike is built right and built to last.  We sweat the carbon layup, frame details, and build kits to ensure the Heckler withstands being repeatedly ridden ‚Äúto the bloody moon‚Äù (and back), whatever the weather back on earth.

The 2022 Santa Cruz Heckler 29 & MX Ebike Review @TheLoamWolf
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúOur time aboard the bike has been plentiful but not nearly enough for our standards of what is required in a long-term review, so stay tuned for that. What we did learn so far however, is that Santa Cruz‚Äôs new Heckler is a lot more capable all around. The range is greatly increased while rollover speed and confidence are better thanks to the larger wheel and updated geometry. What carries over and may even be improved as well is the bike‚Äôs ability to jump, dance, hop and snap with an almost effortless feel.‚Äù

Behind the music with @songhoyblues - The idea behind the #Tallboy3 video was to bring together two of South Africa‚Äôs greatest mountain biking exports; downhill racer @gregminnaar and the Absa @capeepic MTB stage race.

#Tallboy3 first look reviews are starting to roll in !

@bicyclingmag - "The Tallboy is an efficient bike: It feels quick and crisp; and the suspension is very quiet when climbing and accelerating, with little noticeable motion. Santa Cruz‚Äôs VPP system has always been efficient, but the latest iteration on this TB3 feels like the engineers have found a way to make the suspension even more efficient, but without noticeably sacrificing sensitivity. The bike feels fast, but stays connected when pedaling through rough bits, or up and over roots. Here‚Äôs that refrain I mentioned: The TB3 pedals like a shorter travel, XC-style bike, but has the sensitivity of a bike with more travel.‚Äù Check out the full review at the link in our profile. üì∑& words by Bicycling test director @ilikesushi

He knew he wanted the Bronson Kalimotxo frame but also had some inspiration in the form of a very colorful SDG Circuit Mtn Shibuya saddle and here is the result. Some may say too colorful, but i'll be damned if he didn't somehow pull it all off.

Wise words from Tobin Ortenblad / @mctubbbin - "It's funny how self expectation fluctuates throughout a race season. Coming into this year's cross season if you'd have told me I'd place fifth as a first year Elite at US cyclocross nationals, I would've been thrilled. After an incredible season with numerous C2 wins and even a C1 win I came into yesterday wanting more, wanting to win and knowing that I was in a position to do that. Yesterday was an insane race. Viewing the result from an overall season perspective, I am stoked. Three races to go this year, the racing is not over yet"

The Chameleon has evolved.
As the name implies, the Chameleon is a Swiss army knife of bikes, capable of shifting from hardtail ripper to bikepacking mule and everything in between. 
Now adaptable from 29er to 27.5-plus, geared or singlespeed, the Chameleon utilizes a series of swappable dropouts to change modes.
With a low stance and laid-back geometry, the #Chameleon delivers that stable feel that defines the modern trail bike.
Hit the link in our profile for the full details!

Hey Santa Cruz area World Cup DH racing & @scsyndicate fans!
We'll be hosting a LIVE watching party in the @santacruzbicycles showroom starting at 4AM Sunday April 30th (that's tomorrow)
Free coffee, beverages, food, and a promise of a good time with other race fan bed-heads.
Doors open at 4am, Men's finals start at 5am.
BE THERE...Be There...be there.
Address in the Location link.
Well, the weather sucker-punched the men's DH finals in Lourdes, so it looks like  @lorisvergier's  2:52:684 stands as the fastest time on the weekend...congrats to Fayolle on the win.
Temporarily slowed by the weather in Lourdes, the @scsyndicate and #V1029er are still gathering momentum, and are now pointed towards Ft William. Can't wait.

#Singletrack6 Day 2
Alex McGuiness here - aka @krunk_shox - grabbed his #TallboyCC and drove the 15 hours from the thin air of Winter Park, CO to the high, dry Western Kootenay's of BC for the Singletrack6. On day 1 he finished 12th in the GC but also won the timed descent. In typical Krunk fashion he's taking a casual approach to proceedings until he gets on his bike, which is when he turns up the heat. The temperature and very low humidity is really testing riders and the dry, rocky, surprisingly technical (surprisingly for those not familiar with XC racing in BC) trails has meant racers are digging deep already. With 2 days down and 4 to go it could be a battle of attrition as well as ambition.

With a 2nd in Qualifying and only 0.17 seconds off, Greg still holds the total points lead heading in to race day Saturday in Val di Sole.

Not the race we'd hoped for in Val di Sole, as @gregminnaar's rear tire went flat while up at the 2nd split by 1.4 seconds, costing him the overall points lead.

Not the day we were hoping for in Cairns, but damn are we are proud of these guys. 
A great looking run lead to a 7th place finish for @lorisvergier.

An unfortunate slide out in the loose corner at the bottom of the rock garden ended @luca_shaw's chances at a medal but he got back on his bike and still finished in 26th.

@gregminnaar had another spectacular run going and was only 0.3 down at the first split, when his rear tire went flat for the second race in a row. This one was the hard, as Greg's run was looking so good and we all know how strong of a peddler he can be at the bottom of a course where that is what can make-it or break-it. Just not meant to be this time around. 
Hard to believe the 2017 DH season is over, but we are already looking forward to 2018. The boys will be back...with a vengeance. 
Big thanks to all of our sponsors, and everyone that helps make THE SYNDICATE the best team on dirt.

Working in partnership with the Morzine-Avoriaz Tourism Office and the Pleney Lift Company, Santa Cruz is helping develop a brand new DH track for the occasion, on the legendary Pleney mountain.

Syndicate rider @lorisvergier will be there to compete for National honors with the full backing of his @scsyndicate team.  For the past few seasons, teammates @gregminnaar and @luca_shaw have used Morzine as their home from home for training and, erm, not training.

@andespacifico : Day 5 |
How do you summarize the Andes-Pacifico to someone who hasn‚Äôt ridden it? The terrain is brutal, the anti-grip takes ages to get your head around, the days are long, the hike-a-bikes relentless and the temperatures will burn Northern Hemisphere winter skin in a heartbeat. Sounds like hell, right?
WRONG....

This is @nicbean_ . If you demoed a bike from the Factory here in Santa Cruz recently, there‚Äôs a good chance Nic was the one who set up your ride for you. 
In 2017 Nic raced with the EWS team at Aspen and Whistler but this year he‚Äôs making a go for the overall; the Jr. World Champ title. The EWS made a new rule for 2018 that only the best five finishes of eight races will count for the Junior Overall; financially this is great for up and coming riders as it allows them to compete on the world stage.
Nic finished 18th in a field of 70 Juniors at @world_enduro Round 3 in France, which is a good start to see what he can do this season, and we are super excited to see what comes next...High-Five Nic! üñê

@lorisvergier was not as lucky, as a crash at the very top ended his chances for top finish, but he gathered his V10 and pinned the rest of the run to end up 45th, with his jersey looking a little worse for wear.

A project two years in the making, THE NEW V10 has arrived! 
But wait, there are two?!
Oh yes...as we developed the V10.29er race bike for the @SCSyndicate, it became apparent that not all riders would fit on or prefer the 29‚Äù bike, so we made a 27.5 bike, too. To be clear, it's two completely different frames‚Äîthe production versions of both bikes were developed in parallel, and they‚Äôre both the recipients of two seasons of high-level suspension testing and tuning under the Syndicate.

Feel good story of our year...after winning #FiveBucksaFoot, our annual Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship fundraiser for @sierratrails, Michael Knighten of San Francisco was rewarded with his choice of any @santacruzbicycles MTB worth up to $10,000.
BUT instead of claiming the prize for himself,  Michael chose to generously donate five brand new Santa Cruz Chameleons worth $2,000 each to five kids in Plumas County, giving birth to a new program called Knights of the Lost Sierra.
Managed by Mandy Beatty, the STBS Trails Program Coordinator, #KnightsOfTheLostSierra was an open application to any Plumas County youth interested in volunteering 10 separate 5-hour days at SBTS events and trail days, working 50 total hours to ownership of a new mountain bike. 
Over the last year, five youths put in the time and effort, each earning themselves a brand new mountain bike thanks to Michael‚Äôs generosity.
‚ÄúMy favorite thing about this program is the long-term commitment the participants made to service and their public lands‚Äù said Mandy Beatty. ‚ÄúWe started digging on trail days in the snow, sweated it out on Mt Hough and Cascade Trail, and were chasing daylight and cold in the Basin. 
Participants saw and experienced their public lands through all the seasons and it wasn‚Äôt an instant gratification process.‚Äùüí™

Santa Cruz's own @sebkemp narrated this installment of the #Itinerology video series, and it follows Seb and @transprovence founder @ashingtonio on a journey to revive a trail that was lost to time. Once a village highway of necessity, the path has since been reincarnated into a shredder's delight.

We have a Stewardship page on our website. It doesn‚Äôt get a ton of traffic compared to the rest of the site, and hey, we get it. There are a lot of beautiful bikes to look at.
But we also know that without trail builders & trail advocacy efforts we wouldn‚Äôt have anywhere to use those beautiful bikes, so we spend a lot of our time, energy and our money to help those efforts. 
Santa Cruz Bicycles employees get paid days off to go work on trails, both local, and on travel trips. Often times they do it for free. Sometimes they do it for beer. 
In 2018 alone we had 1,411 employee hours volunteered for advocacy, and donated $400,155 to support new trails and for trail maintenance on existing trails.
Most importantly we work with and support many amazing North American trail advocacy organizations including Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship, Mountain Bikers of Santa Cruz (MBoSC), Land Trust of Santa Cruz County (LTSC), Sustainable Trails Coalition (STC), International Mountain Bike Association (IMBA), Trans-Cascadia, Central Oregon Trail Alliance (COTA), Northwest Trail Alliance (NWTA), and more. 
And over the last couple years we have been expanding our reach to international trail advocacy efforts world-wide. 
We can post pretty bike pictures all day long, in fact we love posting those pics, but without the help of all the people and organizations mentioned above there would be a lot less awesome trails out there for all of us to ride on. 
How can you help? Search online or ask your local bike shop if there are local trail building groups you can assist. Get involved and do what you can. Every little bit helps.
And hug your local trail builder today‚ù§Ô∏è

This @StokedOnMS custom Santa Cruz #BronsonCC is being raffled off to raise funds for the @overcomingms charity to help people with MS live long, healthy lives. Only ¬£5 per entry to earn a chance to win.
Contest is open world-wide! Link here - www.stokedonms.org.uk
‚Ä¢
The inspiration for our involvement in this cause is a deeply personal one that started from a professional relationship with our good friends and partners - Andy and Aneela McKenna of @gowherescotlandmtb, a mountain bike guiding business in Scotland.
After years of inspiring us with epic MTB tours of the great Scottish north, Andy now inspires us in his battle against what is currently still an incurable disease, Multiple Sclerosis.
If you‚Äôre already convinced you want this Bronson then click the link and go buy your raffle tickets...but please also click through to read why this is about more than a sweet bike, and hear Andy's story in his own words. We guarantee it will put a little heart, and mind, into your Valentines Day‚ù§Ô∏è

| Stoked On MS Bronson CC - The Details in the Design |
‚Ä¢
When we asked Andy McKenna for inspiration for the design of the @stokedonms benefit bike he said that it had to stand out, look unlike any Santa Cruz Bronson anyone could currently buy, but also look so cool that the raffle winner would still want to ride it.
The topographic design nearly hidden in the orange parts of the paint aren't just generic squiggles but was taken from the old Ordinance Survey maps of the Torridon region in the Scottish Highlands, a place Andy regards above nearly anywhere on earth. 
Part of the reason for Andy's love of the area is that he's spent so much time with his wife, @mrsgowherescotland, staying in bothies, sleeping in bivys  and exploring deep into the area's trails.

Gravel riding offers a bit of roll-your-own style, but these types of races and rides favor light weight over bump absorption, so most opt to leave the suspension at home. This is where the new Reserve700c and 650b wheels really shine.

It‚Äôs in the details where the New Stigmata really shines. 
We loved the previous version so the core DNA is still in there, but the addition of 650b/700c wheel compatibility, increased tire clearance, fender mounts, a 3rd bottle cage mount, threaded BB, flat mount brakes, stealth dropper post compatibility, all in a redesigned chassis with increased compliance highlight the Stigmata‚Äôs ever-widening scope of purpose.

How do you sum up a weekend like the Downieville Classic? Well for one, it's way more than just a weekend ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a way of life for the great people of the Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship and the Downieville community. They have created a modern-day success story. Not the kind of success where some faceless megacorp behemoth makes an over countable amount of money at the expense of the little man. Nope. The kind of success story where a small town on the brink of collapse is now one of the most revered destinations in all of mountain biking - while at the same time creating jobs, trails and a community striving to do good in this world...

@gregminnaar never ceases to amaze...
Less than a second back from the win on a run that was thought to be untouchable, Greg gained time on the whole bottom half of the course but ran out of track, finishing in 2nd.
He‚Äôll take it, but after two 2nd place finishes this season, both by only 10ths of a second, Greg is hungry for another World Cup victory to add to his all-time lead of 21 WC DH wins. #GOAT üêê

@sierratrails has announced the winner of a brand new Hightower and Trailbuilder's Delight package in this year's 5 Bucks a Foot fundraiser and the winner is......(enter excessively long American Idol-like pause)....Lewis Stockton of Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada! Congrats Lewis, we know you'll put that Hightower along with the @evocsports Trail Builder pack, a Trail Boss trail tool and @patagonia Work Wear gear to good use.

Said Lewis upon receiving the news, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm honestly speechless! Thank you so much not just for the bike but for building all the awesome trails and making mountain biking the amazing sport it is!‚Äù
A grand total of $55,496 was raised in this year's 5 Bucks a Foot with 2,321 donors, and all proceeds will go to funding a number of different trails projects we have going in the Lost Sierra region, including the new Beckwourth Peak Trail in Portola, California. We couldn't make #dirtmagic happen without all of your most generous support.

Continuing our V10.7 development story from yesterday, here is our senior industrial designer @dogbox‚Äôs incredible custom #V1029er.
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúThe V10 7 29 was the first Santa Cruz DH bike were I was part of the design team. Downhill has always been my favorite type of riding, and to be able to lead the industrial design for such a legendary DH bike was a something special. I knew I would want a personal V10 29 after riding the engineering test bikes, and it would be cool to have a unique paint job for my bike. 
A few years ago I was at the National Championship Air Race in Reno and saw Planes of Fame's P51-A Miss Virginia. Not to be confused with the Packard built Merlin powered P51-D, Miss Virginia is a P51-A powered by Allison. Also flying still is the AAF's B-25 ‚ÄòExecutive Sweet‚Äô with this same livery of the 1st Air Commando Group. I figured this livery would look pretty cool on a V10.‚Äù

‚ÄúSanta Cruz has knocked it out of the park with this new Stigmata. I honestly can‚Äôt speak to how this bike will perform in a road or cross race but I‚Äôm sure it will hold its own. For my needs, this bike delivered exactly what I was looking for. A solid, reliable ride that won‚Äôt rattle my fillings loose.

@bikemag - The Most Influential Bikes of the Decade - 2010 Santa Cruz Nomad Carbon
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúThe Nomad was known as an overbuilt, rough-and-ready bike edging toward the freeride end of the spectrum, rather than the afternoon-ride end. To most people's surprise, the Nomad C was everything Santa Cruz claimed it would be. It was light (for the time), fast and most importantly, fun. The general reaction to it was something along the lines of, "Holy S#*t."

@bikemag - The Most Influential Bikes of the Decade - 2013 Santa Cruz Bronson
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúThe Bronson was a do-it-all, for-the-fun-of-it play bike. It wasn't committed to any one style of riding, rather it just wanted to be out on the trail having a good time. It jumped well, pedaled well, cornered well and, well, did just about everything well. And that was what most people loved about the Bronson‚Äîit didn't matter what kind of rider you were, you'd probably have a lot of fun on it.  Santa Cruz convinced the public that 27.5 wheels worked and, soon after its release, most of the other big-name brands started churning out their own 27.5 creations‚Äù

Let The Heckling Begin
‚Ä¢
In 1996 the Heckler was created as a rude interruption to mountain bike designs of the time. Its solid, full suspension build and aggressive swagger proved that a well-proportioned trail bike could elevate rider‚Äôs on-trail experiences.
Today‚Äôs Heckler carries all that attitude forward into a new era - A full carbon frame, VPP suspension and pedal-assist merge to create a platform that feels light and agile yet with the power to make rare rides the norm.
‚Ä¢
The New Heckler:
- 150mm VPP¬Æ rear travel, 160mm fork
- 27.5-inch wheels
- 504wh battery capacity
- 65.5-degree head angle
- Available in CC carbon
- Reserve DH/30 carbon wheel option
- Lifetime warranty - Sizes: S-XXL

#LetTheHecklingBegin
When someone like Greg Williams tells you that you should really hurry up and make an e-bike you pay attention.

Greg has said for a long time that the Lost Sierras is ‚Äúa big empty space full of empty trails‚Äù. Some of these trails have been under the nose of riders for years, they‚Äôre just protected by nightmare climbs that deter even the toughest riders. But with the help of a little boost these pieces of singletrack shoot you right from town, fast-forwarding through the torment of 5000ft climbs, to trails like Chimney Rock and Empire Creek - the exact kinds of trails that the title ‚Äúworld‚Äôs best downhill trail‚Äù was made for.

Heckler makes rare rides the norm, turns climbs into sections of trail to enjoy and it‚Äôs still as agile and capable as a regular bike so you can enjoy the really great bits of trail. It was made for places like the Lost Sierras and for adventurous, imaginative riders like Greg Williams.

In February 2020, before everything seemed to change, we sent four of our riders to Chile to find the riding hotspots. But as much as this film is about the places they visited it‚Äôs about the times they shared and the energy they multiplied. This film is about hanging out with friends and celebrating every minute of the day together.
‚Ä¢
Each of these riders is different in every way except that they love two wheels. They show their love differently ‚Äì flat pedals, clips, small wheels, big wheels, Megatowers, Bronsons, race pace, game face, battling for the clip or dance offs at night. This is a film where crass and class aren‚Äôt at odds, where style and speed aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive, where it‚Äôs possible to see that opposites aren‚Äôt incompatible they‚Äôre complimentary.
‚Ä¢
Note: While we‚Äôre in the midst of this global pandemic please respect local health advisories, keep your distance and make clever decisions. The smarter we are now the sooner we‚Äôll all be back out on the trails with friends.

Although Santa Cruz, California is in a shelter-in-place like most of the world, Santa Cruz Bicycles‚Äô R&D team is at work producing face shields (PPE) for local medical staff using sheets of plastic cut using their CNC machinery typically used for cutting carbon fiber as well as 3D printers used for prototyping. 
The equipment is able to make up to 20 face shield lenses every 9 minutes, yielding ~1000 shields per day. Ten days were spent evaluating designs, developing multiple prototypes and getting feedback from local healthcare professionals to ensure the end product suited their needs.  3D printers are used to make reusable and sterilizable support frames using open source CAD designs. Enough material has been procured to produce 8,000 face shields in two different designs in the next week. 75 face shields from the pilot run were delivered to the Santa Cruz County Donation Center today. The team isn‚Äôt working in isolation, this is a community effort, working with volunteers, medical professionals and other local companies to coordinate efforts into effective and rapid action to address the anticipated needs. 
With a little help from everyone, we‚Äôll get through this together and come out as an even tighter community on the other side.

A new weekly series that chronicles the intimate moments between photographer Sven Martin & The Santa Cruz Syndicate.
‚Ä¢
As a photographer, time is normally a commodity I severely lack in life but as a mountain bike photographer specializing in racing, it's something I now have in abundance. It's been a cathartic and fulfilling process dusting off the old hard drives. Sorting, cataloguing and compiling my favourite images and memories they evoke. A task that, no doubt, would have been left until retirement if it weren‚Äôt for these current times.
-
When following, documenting and photographing a singular subject over¬† such a long period of time, certain patterns and story lines emerge. If a picture is worth a thousand words then I have a volume of encyclopedias filled with stories, memories and intimate moments documenting the Santa Cruz Syndicate over the past fifteen years.
-
Where and how does one even begin a project like this? A team of such stature, steeped in both legend and glory with titles and records and the personalities to match. Actually the answer is easy. Steve Peat! The one and only, who, like a fine wine, just keeps getting better with age. From securing the World Cup title in 2006, his very first year with the Syndicate, to grabbing hold of the Rainbow Jersey in 2009 and now aiding and paving the way for the future, each Sunday I will be sharing some of those split seconds in time here. The highs, the lows, the grit and glory with some behind the scenes tech and story.

Greg Minnaar and Fort William are two downhill icons that have truly stood the test of time. As permanent stop on the World Cup circuit since 2002, Greg‚Äôs grabbed 11 podiums and a record breaking 7 wins here, 6 of them on board the Syndicate powered V10. You could say it‚Äôs a match made in heaven even though it feels more like hell out there at times.
-
Whipping wind, rain, sleet and hail on the upper reaches leaves you exposed with nowhere to hide, Greg is one of the best at carrying speed here. Before you can find shelter in the midge infested woods you have to navigate the fastest and longest bedrock section on any World Cup track. Greg's lankiness and ability to find the smoothest lines, combined with the V10‚Äôs extra travel is hard to match here. It‚Äôs a roll of the dice on how the woods are taped, one of the few bits of track to change each year. Then it‚Äôs the drag race down the motorway powering and tucking over the jumps (Greg's speciality) before being welcomed by the biggest and loudest crowd gathered in any finish arena come rain or shine each year. It‚Äôs one of the only venues where I still get goosebumps when it comes down to the final few riders. Something everyone needs to experience at least once. A gathering of clans for the mountain bike fans.
-
The loudest cheers are usually reserved for hometown heroes and royalty (Peaty), Minnaar is one of the few outlanders who brings them to their feet. Ever since embarking on his racing career based in the UK, he has a special affinity with the British fans who have welcomed him as their own. After recently pledging allegiance to the Queen and receiving a British passport, the question is who will receive knighthood first, Greg or Steve?

Young blood, but old hands. Loris & Luca have followed similar trajectories and near parallel career paths during their early years of World Cup racing. In 2014, both juniors, they are neck on neck, trading wins, two a piece and it‚Äôs a battle right to the end of the season, finishing 1st & 2nd respectively. Grabbing top tens finishes (a podium for Loris) as rookie Elites they both further cement themselves into the top ten with podiums in their 2nd year.
-
Both have loving and supporting families with cycling in their veins, Claude Vergier battles Bruni senior at Masters Worlds mirroring the ongoing battle between their respective offspring in the majors, While Doug Shaw goes about nabbing all the major Cols in Europe as Luca tackles the rough downhills tracks.
-
In 2017 they are both conscripted into the Syndicate. Collectively they bring down the average age of the team significantly. The move is genius not only is the future bright for the Syndicate but the challenge of youth re-ignites a fire within Minnaar and he goes on a stormer proving there‚Äôs still plenty of bite left in the top dog. With big shoes to fill and no doubt some weighty expectations on their shoulders they waste no time in turning heads. All eyes are on them at the season opener, new year, new team, new bike and new BIG wheel size. Luca and Loris go one and three in qualifying, they have arrived!
-
A couple of years of highs and lows for both of them, a slew of wins in qualifying and some frustrating crashes. Bad luck with niggling injuries they still push relentlessly, already podium proven they are now both after the win. It comes first for Loris, bittersweet watching from the hot seat as teammate, number one qualifier and last man down, Luca crashes out in Andorra. Loris is buoyed on by another duo of French Revolutionaries and more podiums soon follow. Luca grabs a couple but will no doubt be wanting to balance the scales more evenly once again and bring his version of the Red White and Blue onto the top step. I can‚Äôt wait to see how their intertwined story continues to develop when we head out healthy and ready to race again.

2020 marks @KathySessler‚Äôs 17th year at the helm of The Syndicate.
In all that time there have only ever been 6 team riders, so clearly she is doing something right. When riders sign, they become part of the family. It can be no easy task dealing with a team of such individual and larger than life characters. No doubt her past experience as a bike-riding stunt women comes in handy keeping them all in check. Then as a past successful racer herself, she knows what a rider needs to do their best. With top ten World Cup DH results and a masters World Champs in the 90‚Äôs she almost matches her riders resumes, earning her nickname ‚ÄúOne Fast Mother‚Äù
‚Ä¢
Taking on a lot more than just cooking and booking she invests herself emotionally with the team too. She‚Äôs handy with the camera, puts out sponsor books, hosts a mid season team Christmas dinner with presents and all, she keeps them distracted when they need it and focussed when it‚Äôs time to perform. On race day there is always hidden Champagne on ice in the pits in case one of her boys win, but she will just as graciously gift it to another team with a winning rider. True class!
‚Ä¢
It‚Äôs very much a two way relationship and her boys have been showing their appreciation by gifting her a unique charm to fill a very special bracelet she began building in 2008. Each win, big result or special milestone is recorded with the appropriate keepsake of gold, silver, diamonds, sapphires, onyx, wood and Murano glass. 
Roskopp, Bryceland, Peaty and Minnaar all filling one in four short years. The second edition is already in the making, we hope you have room on your wrist for many more‚Ä¶ We love you Kathy.

Santa Cruz is a company of people brought together by a love of bicycles.
But bikes aren‚Äôt everything.
‚Ä¢
We‚Äôre deeply saddened and troubled by the events surrounding George Floyd‚Äôs death, and it‚Äôs plain to see the societal wounds it‚Äôs torn open.
‚Ä¢
One of our core beliefs is that bikes can be used as a force for good. We don‚Äôt just believe in quality bicycles, we believe in quality of life.
What does that mean? We work hard to find good things we can do in our communities and invest our time, sweat, and dollars to make it happen.
‚Ä¢
How do we, as a bike company, positively impact racial injustice and inequality?
Posting on social media‚Äôs not going to solve it, but we want to make sure our employees, athletes, and customers of color know that we support them and have their backs.
We want equality for all people, and we want justice brought to those assholes who deserve it.
‚Ä¢
We know the world can be better, and we‚Äôre going to be part of making that happen.

If there‚Äôs somebody who has seen & done it all in racing; its Doug ‚ÄúHattrick‚Äù Hatfield. Tuning and tweaking on bikes is part of his DNA, from building his first MTB in the 70‚Äôs (before you could buy them) while still in high school, to working as a full time tech for the US National and Olympic team in the early nineties before moving on to big factory race teams. He‚Äôs worked in road, track, XC, trials & CX before joining Santa Cruz in 2002 and has been heading up Syndicate‚Äôs team support since 2006. During that time he‚Äôs wrenched for every single rider that‚Äôs worn the syndicate stripes, forever the constant & always with a smile and positive infectious attitude that lightens up the pits.
-
There are little tricks, secrets & personal touches that every good mechanic has up their sleeve, but few exude a peaceful, caring & calming aura like Dougie Fresh. I‚Äôve witnessed Minnaar make a last minute decision, while sat in a wet Fort William start gate, to back his pedal pins out a turn for a little extra grip. Doug without panic or fluster magically produces the correct allen and gets the job done with seconds to spare. He‚Äôs that rock you want in your corner.
-
He will build the perfect wheel in under 20 minutes but he will go the extra mile to break in a fresh set of bearings too. Run in bearings roll faster and you can sometimes spot him spinning out the bearings with a high speed drill to conjure up those few extra milliseconds for his rider.  Sometimes there‚Äôs a personal message or an old lucky number board hidden behind the current one, or a fun custom sticker lurking somewhere on the frame that makes all the difference. Experienced hands, some zen wisdom and a stoked happy rider make for a winning package.
-
After thirty years of wrenching Dougie returns for another year as Service Course Manager, a full time job staying on top of the mundane (parts and spares, forecasting, ordering & packing) while still bringing the magic with his forever youthful spark and enthusiasm.

Everyone‚Äôs listened to vinyl records right? You are either old enough that it was part of your youth or young enough that it‚Äôs now the hipster thing to do. Growing up I always had an appreciation & fascination for the B sides. They were the meat & potatoes of an album, often featuring the experimental musical wanderings. The A-Side hits got the attention, radio play & paid the bills, but it was the blue collar B sides that would define a band.
-
This post is dedicated to these unsung heros. The B siders, working hard behind the scenes, night & day, early till late. The job is never done nor clearly defined. Despite what their titles & job descriptions suggest the use of their respective tools of the trade is often the easiest & least important ingredient to the Syndicates success. They bring years of knowledge, experience, wisdom & sometimes just rock solid, quick thinking Kiwi ingenuity to the table. I present you Marshy, Laura, PA, Jordi and Joe.
-
Marshy may appear gruff & gritty on the outside but has the biggest heart. When he‚Äôs not puzzling with Greg or inventing products, he‚Äôs quietly helping out desperate deserving privateers on the side.
-
Laura has the magic healing hands and always knows what the riders need. Rehab, pre race warm ups or post race recovery she keeps them finely tuned.
-
PA was already quite the seasoned traveller & mechanic before he joined the Syndicate to work with fellow Frenchman. Together with Loris they have brainstormed & tested some wild ideas and concepts. Neither afraid to break new ground.
-
Fox‚Äôs Jordi, is pretty much family. The yin to Gregs & Loris‚Äô yang. His perpetual patience and  generous sharing of (after hours) cocktails or home-brew make him welcome in the pits anytime.
-
Joe Bowman, has his finger on the pulse and ultimately is the one that makes the boys all look good. Also current reigning Media World Champion.
-
All of the above living proof that every now and then, like Queen‚Äôs We Will Rock You there‚Äôs a sleeper hit hiding on the B side.

If it wasn‚Äôt for Dirt Magazine I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am now. Simple as that. Before Dirt entered my life, I was a full time skateboarder and undercover mountain biker. MTB was my dirty secret that I hid from my skateboarding brethren, it just wasn‚Äôt cool. Then in the early 2000‚Äôs I happened across a copy of Dirt Magazine, an eye opening revelation in stark contrast to the existing mainstream. A whole new subculture & lifestyle celebrating individuality, performance & style. Cutting edge photography paired with frenetic design & clean layouts of creative chaos. Bikes were passports to pleasure, from dreamy alpine road trips to dark wet pub ride frenzies but it was the rarefied & glorified world of downhill racing that was celebrated most & held in highest regard. I was hooked. It‚Äôs hard to convey just how much influence, pull & power Dirt had, gracing its pages was an honour & covers were lusted & fought over if you were a rider or photographer.
-
Come end of year it was an almost sure bet the it would go to the most deserving or break out rider that year. In 2008 that man of the moment was Greg Minnaar. With the World Cup Series wrapped up only four days prior in a wet Schladming, we now found ourselves in polar opposite conditions under the scorching sun of Las Vegas trying to deliver an eye catching cover commissioned by the ever particular Dirt editor/visionary Mike Rose. AKA god.
-
Greg, still jet lagged & hung over from trans-Atlantic celebrations, arrived with no riding kit other than helmet & goggles & his bike still had spikes on, an incongruent anomaly here in the desert. Combined with the ever present Inter-bike distractions, I had my work cut out.
-
Luckily I had the ‚Äúend of year Dirt cover shot‚Äù cheat sheet up my sleeve. I knew Mike was a sucker for the ‚Äúblue sky, dry dirt shot‚Äù since this issue would hit the shelves during the dark gloomy days of the British winter & I already knew of a zone where I had shot Steve Peat  carving a turn two years earlier that made the cover. After a couple of turns and only two jumps I knew we had captured something special & perfect for a cover.

When I was a kid my dad used to take me to watch cricket. Now cricket is nothing like baseball. It drags on for five days and sometimes even then there is no winner. What I remember most from those long hot days under the sun was that the fans were often more interesting than the game itself especially in the afternoons when the beers had been flowing for a few hours, giving the streakers the dutch courage needed to liven up the game a little.
While cricket and DH Racing are polar opposites the spirit of the fans remains the same.
-
Being a true fan is a proper sport in itself and one that can be every bit as serious as the racing it follows. Big crowds and loud fans can transform a good World Cup into a great one come finals day. The deafening electrifying atmosphere in the finish bowl gives me goosebumps, elevating my heart rate and raising the hair on my arms, my own endomorphic spike raising the stakes that much more and only ever felt on finals day at a select few races.
-
Fort William is legendary for its fan turnout and their dedicated passion, no matter what the weather. They will walk the track from top to bottom dressed in all sorts of outfits each year waving sharpie scrawled cardboard signs professing their loyalty to their favourite riders in some fitting and witty way Other iconic venues like Mt St Anne, Val Di Sole, Andorra, Lenzerheide and Leogang all have sardine filled finish areas and the French fans, well they are hard to beat, they are as crazy about cycling as they are over the Syndicate. The Aussie fans are there for the party and will bury beer and Bundy filled eskies weeks before a venue is fenced off. South Africa fields a loud, large and dedicated One Life Crew, cursedly armed with vuvuzelas, that will mysteriously  pop up on the other side of the world en masse whenever Greg wins a race. Then there is a long time Syndicate fan who is so committedly all in that he has to go by the pseudonym ‚ÄúIvan‚Äù to protect his real identity.
-
Without the fans racing is simply not the same. Hopefully I have more than cricket to look forward to in the near future.

Dreams we were both able to fulfill, albeit with different degrees of success; Rob had one of the all-time best selling skate decks, while I was eating 2-minute noodles & hitchhiking around California, living the dream.
As fate would have it, our paths briefly crossed one night in 1992 at a downtown San Jose skate park. 10 years older than me, Rob was already hooked on bikes and in the planning stages with Santa Cruz Bicycles, which he launched soon after. Star struck then, it took me another 10 years before I found bikes and as they say, the rest is history.
‚Ä¢
The point of my story is that the roots run deep with both Santa Cruz and The Syndicate. It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint exactly what makes both so successful, but it is certainly more than just the sum of the parts. Wild, all risking rebellious abandon juxtaposed with savant-like determination, practice and perfection. All traits & pathways to success, be it in skateboarding, running a company, or becoming a top downhill racer. Rob has built more than a brand, he has built a family and a following.
‚Ä¢
I figured out pretty early on with The Syndicate any conundrum can be overcome by either a statement or a question - It‚Äôs either a DTR ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell Rob‚Äù when maybe a rental car gets damaged, or WWRD ‚ÄúWhat would Rob do?‚Äù when you are wondering whether to splash out on another round of celebratory drinks on the team credit card.
‚Ä¢
What I have seen most since I‚Äôve got to know Rob better, is that The Syndicate is more than a line item to him. It‚Äôs his love & his family. His heart and soul are fully invested. Never resting, even when winning, he‚Äôs the driving force in R&D in the off season, and when racings back on you will find him in the mud trackside during training. Then getting the party started in the pits when there‚Äôs celebrating to be done.
‚Ä¢
Having roots in skateboarding doesn‚Äôt automatically buy you street cred, but it sure does rub off when building one of the most iconic bike racing teams in history - The Syndicate.

The first time I shot Fort William was also the last time I raced there. It was the 2007 World Champs and I was racing for South Africa.
Managing & riding for a team with a tight budget meant I had to have side jobs to fund the dream. I was just starting to shoot for a few mags, but since I was also racing I had no real clients. Somehow I managed to hustle shooting Worlds for Decline Magazine. I sold my concept to editor Scott Hart, that the whole feature should only focus on the action & emotions from in & around the finish area on race day.
I never told him that the real reason was because I had to be on my bike, practicing & racing during the rest of the week.
I did my run, then quickly grabbed my gear, and proceeded to shoot the fast guys who came down last. Job done!
‚Ä¢
Twelve years on, and it‚Äôs still largely the finish area photos that matter most at Ft William. From the roar of the crowd when the racers launch into view through the VISIT SCOTLAND arch until they cross the finish line, the amount of iconic shots on offer for a quick thinking, quicker moving photographer is unrivaled by any other World Cup stop. Racing photography is all about telling the day's story, complimenting the venues vibe and capturing the nail biting action. And you never know who is going to win until the final rider crosses the line. With a 3 rider team I try to mix it up to offer some variety, but moving anywhere in the finish arena that‚Äôs packed with rowdy fans and only 3+ minutes between riders.
The best, and most fitting way to to describe it would be choreographed chaos. It can be a gamble, but I‚Äôve learned to trust my gut instinct. And if all else fails, and you end up stuck in no-mans-land, I pray and trust that my pre-set remote cameras will save the day.
‚Ä¢
I have to admit that after that busy day in 2007 I left Scotland more excited with my photos than by my race results, and without realizing it at the time, it was to be my final big UCI DH race behind the bars. From 2008 onwards I became a full-time photographer. One who is lucky enough to still get that race day fix of endorphins pumping through my veins.

Outside the tape. 
‚Ä¢
While the list of Syndicate titles, championships & accolades is a long one, what makes them so successful is that they know how to find a balance both during & after the race season. Mental & physical stresses can easily take their toll during the yearly cycle & they know a bow that is too tightly strung is all too easily broken, so distractions are both sought & needed.
With their reputation you wouldn‚Äôt be far off the mark in assuming that this would manifest itself in a couple of rounds of beers, or bottles of wine. That goes without saying, but they are, thankfully, more multidimensional than that.
‚Ä¢
From the beginning Steve has always been the peoples champ, and that didn‚Äôt change when he finally became the World Champ. Alongside various business endeavours he‚Äôs always made a point of spreading the joys of riding world wide and is only too happy to give back to his local community as well.
‚Ä¢
Greg is a gifted and multi-talented sportsman. Golf, moto, surfing and cliff diving, he does it all.  He‚Äôs also the first to open the wine after track walk day.
‚Ä¢
Josh loves to ride and loves to get naked,. Sometimes both at the same time. Any bike, any place, any time. He didn‚Äôt need a sculpted or manicured bike park, just some good beats and irie vibes.
‚Ä¢
Loris leads a mysterious double life, he‚Äôs managed to stealthily train for his secret passion of enduro despite being feverishly courted by the French fashion houses. Eschewing their inevitable grasp for one more season.
‚Ä¢
Despite his youth, Luca‚Äôs Zen wisdom runs deep, he‚Äôs always marched to his own beat. When he‚Äôs outside the tape on Sundays there's a good chance you can find him watching and supporting his better-half inside the tape, needless to say he spends more time on his XC bike these days even though he doesn‚Äôt ride it like one.
‚Ä¢
But it was Kirt Voreis, one of the Syndicate original members who first figured out the importance of balance and life beyond the tape. Pioneering new professional paths simply by following his passions. We love you Kirt, don‚Äôt ever change.

A tall, wise man from Sheffield once said, ‚ÄúWin or lose, we on the booze.‚Äù While it may have been slurred in an earlier era; long before coaches, road bike intervals, go pros, nutritionists & trainers changed the face of DH racing, it still holds mostly true today.
‚Ä¢
We‚Äôve already glorified & celebrated the many Syndicate victories in this series but as I‚Äôve priorly postulated, the universe always ensures a degree of balance. The Jedi Knights wouldn‚Äôt be so venerated without the Sith Lords. Even our Syndicate Jedi‚Äôs take their knocks from time to time & a few battles are lost along the way and sorrows drowned overnight.
‚Ä¢
I‚Äôve seen Steve so bruised & battered, barely able to hobble yet still throws his leg over his bike and sails down the course. It‚Äôs the getting back up that counts. His biopic fittingly titled ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt Back Down‚Äù & by now we‚Äôve all become accustomed to him sinking a few Stellas along the way.
‚Ä¢
Bryceland has had his fair share of hard knocks. Going for broke, literally, on more than one occasion. You would think he would have learnt his YOLO lesson as junior in the infamous Maribor rock garden but in true Ratboy fashion he never changed his riding or approach to life, even when ahead in the biggest race of the year. God Bless The Rat.
‚Ä¢
I‚Äôve witnessed Minnaar dislocate his shoulder entering the Mont St Anne rock garden, carry on & pop his shoulder back in on the exit out. Insane.
But what will forever remain burnt in both my sensor and memory banks is his spectacular crash in Val Di Sole where he folded both himself & bike around a solid pole at near terminal velocity, casually walk it off & after a full bike rebuild still qualify 2nd. Nerves of steel that man & an appetite & instigator when it comes to the liquid gold. He might have even lost his bike once in a French farmers field, never to be found again but that is another story.
‚Ä¢
Loris and Luca both hail from the new school of professional athletes & as such failure usually fuels more stringent training, analysis followed up by a punishing hot road climb or workout, but thankfully even they too let their hair down in true Syndicate spirit now and again.

Fly On The Wall
‚Ä¢
Many of my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù friends often ask me how much longer am I going to keep doing this; Leaving home, living out of a bag for seven months each year just to photograph other people racing bikes. On the surface that is a pretty valid question, my response mirrors the cliched Confucius quote, ‚ÄúChoose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.‚Äù
Confucius obviously never had to try to find working internet in Scotland at 3am, never spilled a beer onto his MacBook at midnight & never had to fly around the world with his whole life in two overweight bags, but he was definitely on to something. I‚Äôve been shooting World Cup racing for just over thirteen years now but luckily as a photographer every day offers something new, even at some of the tired old repeat venues. I‚Äôm out in nature with fresh mountain air & get to witness & document some of the greatest feats of human coordination, skill, determination & bravery. No two days are alike, no outcomes are predetermined, be it in the weather, light or action. I get to see some amazing things and do my best to document it justly for posterity's sake.
‚Ä¢
There are stories to be told everywhere, sometimes I manufacture and plan shots, like a sneaky pole cam shot intruding on Steve getting rid of his nerves in a bathroom stall moments before his race run up top near the start of Ft William. Other times, moments just present themselves in front of you, like a fox crossing my path while I quietly lie waiting for a shot, or a snake slithering by while I‚Äôm in deep in the bush setting up for a sneaky secret sniper shot. Moments in nature that make you forget you are just at another bike race. Never mind the poor spider covered in neon course marking spray inching its way down the roots that I‚Äôm zoomed in on waiting for a tyre to appear. Old rediscovered shots allow you to relive forgotten moments, bring smiles and spark emotions.
Details, stories, angles & emotions, it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a maiden WC win celebration or some bandy legged goon riding, it‚Äôs these fly on the wall moments that keep me coming back each and every year.

My first ever World Cup I raced was Kaprun 2003. It was also the first time I ever raced in the mud, the first time I rode spikes and my qualifying run was the first time I ever used flats (clips simply wouldn‚Äôt work) Hailing from Southern California at the time I had no experience in wet weather conditions. I remember asking Greg Minnaar, who I barely knew at the time, what the trick or technique was, he advised me to ride it like its dry and if I felt it sliding get on the pedals and power down for grip. He placed 2nd in the final, I just qualified and ended up 52nd.
‚Ä¢
For most mere mortals, mud means mayhem but for the cream of the crop, like the Syndicate, they still, somehow, manage to ride it like it‚Äôs dry. While practise, familiarity, tire choice, suspension settings and skilful technique go a long way in making mud manageable it‚Äôs really mental fortitude that allows you to stay off the brakes commit to the big high wet rooty off-camber lines come race day. You either have it or you don‚Äôt.
‚Ä¢
Some tracks benefit from moisture at some point in the week, preferably Thursday or Friday to offer prime racing conditions come Sunday, but then there are those odd occasions when no matter your pedigree when you add ill timed showers to hard pack clay all you are left with is a dice roll and a hail Mary. Lourdes 2017 springs to mind here. Ruts, roots, roll-offs, and raincoats, ironically all regularly feature during the summer European race season. High temperatures & even higher mountains fuel & feed the sudden violent & often recalcitrant thunderstorms.
‚Ä¢
For a photographer it‚Äôs a double edged sword. I love the rain for all its drama, contrast & creativity it brings. Old venues painted with a new patina, vivid saturation, wet rich greens and dark muddy moody contrasts pierced, sliced and spiced with streaking rain are a blessing but when it‚Äôs accompanied by wind or humidity, it quickly turns into an expensive, frustrating, blurry mess of foggy sensors and short circuited systems.
‚Ä¢
What will the return to racing bring? I‚Äôll definitely still be packing the gore tex and brollies, maybe even a snow parka.

‚ÄúBy the time we rolled away from the trailhead, the 5010 was already the undisputed parking lot champ of the test, and the good times just kept rolling throughout our test lap. This bike has a way of inviting you to jib, skid and wheelie like you‚Äôre a high schooler ditching class to go ride. It‚Äôs nothing but fun.‚Äù

Sundays With Sven
‚Ä¢
The Syndicate is primarily known as a thoroughbred DH race team, but like most of us they also spend a lot of time on their short travel bikes. They might not admit it but they also love to race a bit of enduro when the seasons schedule allows for it and have competed in a handful of EWS events over the years.
‚Ä¢
Greg, the ever competitive racer didn‚Äôt waste time getting stuck in during the early formative years of the Enduro World Series. The chance to race past nemeses Fabien Barel and Nico Vouilloz again was probably enough to get Minnaar to sign up. In only his second Enduro World Series event he managed to land himself on the Podium in third place alongside fellow World Champions Nico and Graves, proving that should he choose to he could also master this longer more endurance focussed form of gravity racing.
‚Ä¢
Steve gets to spend a lot more time on the ‚Äúshort travel‚Äù bikes these days and can often be seen matching the teams speeds during DH test camps on his enduro bike. During the early days of EWS he too showed his pedigree with some top ten finishes. These days we get to see him truly discover just how far & deep into the backcountry these bikes can take you in the wilder more adventurous enduro races like Trans Provence and the NZ Enduro, where mixing racing with beer stops is encouraged not frowned upon. Perfect for uncle Steve.
‚Ä¢
Having only competed in one EWS event in Finale as a season (B)ender which involved more beer, cappuccinos and gelato than serious effort Luca prefers to keep his focus strictly DH although when he chooses to he‚Äôs a force to be reckoned with, nabbing a Trans Cascadia podium in 2018.
‚Ä¢
Perhaps out of the bunch the one with the biggest Enduro fettish would be our famously fast Frenchie Loris Vergier. As a junior he took a win over the ever dominant Martin Maes then a few more legendary scalps with his Trans Cascadia win. If he didn‚Äôt have such a big future ahead of him in DH the enduro guys would have something to worry about.
‚Ä¢
With the EWS wrapping up this weekend in Finale lets reminisce on some of Syndicates early exploits and dabbling in Enduro World Series racing.

Sundays With Sven 
One Shot
‚Ä¢
I only got to race three World Champs, a flat tire bookended with two (ok three) over the bars summed my worlds experience during my short lived DH ‚Äúcareer‚Äù. However it‚Äôs the memories and immense feeling of pride and patriotism when donning the green and gold ‚Äúbig five animal‚Äù South African Jersey, representing the rainbow nation alongside much more accomplished riders like Anka and Greg Minnaar is something that I‚Äôll cherish forever. They got issued skin suits, but for some reason the federation decided the baggy rugby jersey would better suited to me.
‚Ä¢
While the World Cup series title proves who the best rider is all year, there‚Äôs no denying the allure and pull of the magical rainbow jersey, one only has to look at Steve Peats‚Äôs 17 year quest to appreciate this. In it‚Äôs time the Syndicate has amassed 11 medals, four of them gold and they are just getting warmed up with young fresh talent from the bench now ready to make their own mark in the history books alongside Minnaar who is no doubt looking to snag a few more before he calls it a day, few can raise their game for the big matches like the lanky South Africanüáøüá¶
‚Ä¢
Then there are the kits and matching bikes. The bikes, wow there have been some gems, each year something unique drawing from fresh inspiration and providing that little  extra bit of motivation.  Some years the designs are personal and detailing cryptic and others follow a team theme thread, but it‚Äôs the patriotic ones that do it for me and stand the test of time.
‚Ä¢
It‚Äôs been company tradition that every winning bike ends up in the hands of the sports biggest super fan, none other than our very own Rob Roskopp, so it took a special kind of shell game, bike box switcheroo heist at the Canberra airport for Sir Steve PEAT to retain rightful ownership of his gold winning chariot. Rob had to settle for the replica this time around.
‚Ä¢
What will this years bikes look like? Decals, paint and powder coat, we‚Äôve seen it all. With all three riders ready to give it their all, will Roskopp need to make some more space on his wall?

What's next after you Everest and then climb out of the stratosphere? The tallest plantery mountain in the solar system, that's what.
‚Ä¢
After Everesting a few years back, then climbing and descending 55,000 vertical metres in only 30 days last December, all while holding down his full-time bike-mechanic job at @vertigo_bikes_queenstown, the question many had for @benhildred was what's next?
‚Ä¢
It was his boss, Paul "Pangus" Angus, who suggested Olympus Mons, a volcano on the planet Mars that stands 21,287.4m (69,841ft) above datum, said to be the tallest planetary mountain in the solar system, roughly two and a half times the height of Mt. Everest. After exiting the stratosphere with his last attempt it made sense to continue further out into space to find the next ascent to conquer.
‚Ä¢
The Olympus Mons challenge is simple: Climb at least 21,288m in just 72 hours. Each day must consist of one ride, each ride must be on a different climb and descent loop, but the whole ride has to be completed on the same bike. Ben, being a Queenstown local did the whole thing on a mountain bike (a Tallboy), mostly off-road.
‚Ä¢
In November Ben led the first exhibition to figuratively climb Olympus Mons. For the next three days we'll recap his odyssey here on @santacruzbicycles

Mission: Olympus Mons Day 02 - Life On Mars?
‚Ä¢
@benhildred gets a lift off some friendly earthlings among the cold of outer space.
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúBleak, bare, brutal.
Coronet Peak was the location today. 
First lap: snow, hail and freezing temperatures at the top of the trail. I had to look where my feet were as I couldn't feel my pedals. My fingers were long gone. Lap two of the second day was the hardest, most gruelling of the whole campaign, even the ascent in the dark and rain didn't warm me up. It‚Äôs the closest I've ever come to falling asleep at the bars. My 'blinks' were questionable. I found some yellow foam matting used for the ski fields under cover and had a quick nap at the top, it was the comfiest I think I'd ever been. Rolling into the snow to start the descent took next level will power.
‚Ä¢
Lap three I was welcomed midway up the climb by friends, Steve and Gnomes, carrying water bottles, warm drinks and warm smiles. They possessed the enthusiasm I'd forgotten about that morning. I felt alive again, fuelled by their encouragement and fancy English breakfast tea. The sun eventually did come out on day two and it got warm. The trails were busy and the morning, only a few hours before, seemed like a distant memory. Once again I was joined by good sorts for laps up and down, listening to their conversation passed the climbs and the growing monotony.
‚Ä¢
The descent was mainly down ‚ÄòRude Rock‚Äô, a Queenstown classic. I rode it in snow, slop, hero dirt, and dust powder all within a few hours. A hill bomb down the road to finish aided recovery from a well trodden tourist trail, luckily the day before made the knuckle tearing more tolerable. Rubbing Deep Heat between my fingers helped too...‚Äù

Mission: Olympus Mons Day 03 - Mission Critical
Looting Interants and a Return to Home
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúI'd earned a proper night's sleep after the second day ‚Äì a whole seven whole hours. I started later, not on the road until 4am. This was it, only 7200m to go. Only.
‚Ä¢
The temperature change from bottom to the base building of the ski fields was a real wake up call, flashbacks of the day before were filling my head and clouding my defensive wall of positive, determined thoughts. I'd strategically placed my favorite Misspent Summers (very apt) jumper at the bottom as something to look forward to. But it disappeared around lap two, likely pinched by the occupants of an overflowing, shaggy looking campervan, the only people I saw that morning. That frustration got me up lap three.
‚Ä¢
The whole @vertigo_bikes_queenstown crew and friends joined me for the last lap. The weather took an abysmal turn for the worst half way up. We were riding in hail and head winds. The end was in sight but we couldn't see much through the cloud we found ourselves in. Thank you to everyone who came out for laps over the past three days. It really helped.
‚Ä¢
My 72 hours went great. My bike was faultless and my body although exhausted was not devastated. I chose to run the Tallboy for its efficiency, seating position and stability, even when I wasn‚Äôt so stable. Running the effortless and reliable SRAMS AXS groupset gave one less thing to worry about. Coupled with my flat pedals, 34 tooth chainring and lack of chamois I had a winning combo.
‚Ä¢
I can now tick this one off, and more importantly share it with the cycling community. Being the admin of the OlympusMons.cc site I‚Äôm excited to see other efforts. I‚Äôd hope these daft rides inspire some of you to set your own goals. Mountain biking can be gnarly in so many ways, whether for that endorphin or adrenalin buzz. What a sick, sick sport......What‚Äôs next?‚Äù

The Syndicate:
No Time to Cry
2020 World Champs & World Cup
‚Ä¢
While the latest James Bond film continues to be postponed, The Syndicate steps in for your eyes only... filling the void with a new feature length episode.
‚Ä¢
Joe Bowman‚Äôs gold finger has been on the button to capture the World Championships and World Cups from this spectre of a year.
‚Ä¢
Sky fall in the shape of rain and snow meant the Worlds was not enough to satisfy most race fans this season.  Thankfully the team charged into the following races with a view to a kill.  And kill it they did, with Luca returning to form, Loris taking back-to-back wins in Maribor, and Greg taking a 1st and 2nd place in Lousa. Proving you never say never again when it comes to The G.O.A.T.
‚Ä¢
And Peaty? He‚Äôs been like a man on her majesty‚Äôs secret service, gathering intel from every corner of the mountain and feeding it back to the riders to prepare for changing track conditions.  Thanks to all the crew‚Äôs hard work, the Syndicate brought home the #1 team ranking for the year.
‚Ä¢
This latest installment of The Syndicate franchise also marks Loris Vergier‚Äôs final appearance as a Santa Cruz agent.  After four great years together, it‚Äôs time to say au revoir to the self-proclaimed #7.  We‚Äôre proud to have supported Loris‚Äô rise from fast frenchie to World Cup winner and we wish him all the best for the futureüñ§
‚Ä¢
Greg, Luca and Steve all remain on the team for next year along with all our main partners.  You can follow the Santa Cruz Syndicate‚Äôs continuing exploits on the team homepage, Instagram and Youtube.
‚Ä¢
2020 has been an odd year but we leave the races completely stirred, not shaken, and are looking forward to the 2021 season already. So until then, grab a Vesper Martini, tune into the episode and enjoy a Happy Holidays from all of us!

Review:  The New Nomad - First Impressions  NSMB.com
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúEvery once in awhile something in life comes along that alters what you believe is true. The parameters determined by experience are eroded by new information. Or sometimes it's old information presented in a new way. It wasn't that I thought I no longer liked 650b wheels, it was simply that I was quite sure I preferred 29. When I became so enamoured with the most recent incarnation of the Santa Cruz Bronson, I wasn't fully aboard the 29er train but since that time I've ridden big wheels almost exclusively, with the odd fat or mullet foray. And I thought I was done. It turns out my my unwritten obituary for anything smaller than 29" wheels was premature...‚Äù

Santa Cruz PayDirt Fund Profile - Ridgeline‚Äôs Garfagnana Bike Project

Rich & Sandra are joint founders and owners of Ridgeline, which is a mountain bike holiday company operating and based out in the Northern Tuscany region in a place called the Garfagnana. (Pronounced: Gar-fan-yaa-na!).
‚Ä¢
They set up Ridgeline back in 2015 as an escape from the corporate rat race in England and Germany and had the shared dream of having the adventure of setting up a totally new MTB destination from scratch in an relatively unknown part of the world.
‚Ä¢
Sandra and Rich spent years pouring over maps to find our untouched white spot with the perfect mountains and where no one else was operating. And six years later here they are with about 250km of trail network created, including 98km of hand-built tracks, an incredible team, and amazing guests that return year-after-year.

The Beta Tests: Santa Cruz Nomad X01 CC
‚Ä¢
New Nomad review from the new @BetaMTB crew:
‚ÄúThe Santa Cruz Nomad is its own animal, never really feeling like its goal is to go head-to-head with the more race-ready rigs in the test, but rather do the opposite. It offers a distinctly different ride quality, aiming at creativity over speed and encouraging pop over planted-ness. It got one tester rethinking the one-bike quiver that modern design and technology have finally made possible. The new Nomad offers so much pure fun that it doesn‚Äôt feel like it would be redundant in any garage. Just different in the best kind of way...‚Äù

Luke Cryer defines style at speed. He came from the world of gate starts and elbows, even winning silver & bronze medals at the 2015/2016 4X World Championships. Now it‚Äôs the thrill of pitching himself against himself that holds most worth.
‚Ä¢
In 2020 Luke was looking for a new bike and hit up Josh @loosedoglewis seeing if he had any leads on something brand new or second-hand.
Loose Dog lives the mantra of ‚Äúpay it forward‚Äù and has been passing along his old bikes to friends and helping talented friends get setup with bikes through his sponsors for a while. Loose managed to get his hands on a bike wasn‚Äôt being used and it became Luke‚Äôs new ride.
And this is what he does with it.
‚Ä¢
It‚Äôs good to get something new, but if a bike is built to last then there‚Äôs no reason it can‚Äôt have many lives. Santa Cruz builds quality bikes that can take a beating and kept running for many lifetimes. Pay it forward.

Fastest Known Time on the White Rim Trail
‚Ä¢
The newly assembled Santa Cruz htSQD loaded their bikes in the van and headed to Moab to attempt to grab the fastest known time on the White Rim Trail, 100 miles of dusty, wind-battered off-road trail in Canyonlands National Park.
Aboard for the ride were Keegan Swenson, Alexis Skarda & Tobin Ortenblad - A team of individuals with an XC addiction.
‚Ä¢
Keegan and Alexis have been down this road before, as they are both former FKT/WRT record holders before having their respective times bested in 2020.
Tobin decided to make an attempt at the FKT for the clockwise direction, which is the opposite of the traditional route. 
‚Ä¢
7 hrs later ALL were successful:
Keegan's time - 5:28:17 *New FKT - Just 6 seconds faster than the previous record.
Alexis' time - 6:52:55 *New Women‚Äôs FKT - 4 minutes and 5 seconds faster than the previous record.¬†
Tobin's time - 6:16:38 - *New FKT for the clockwise direction.
Amazing work crewüôå

White Rim//FKT Playlists - Echoes In The Pain Cave
‚Ä¢
What music do you queue up when you are about to head out on a self supported ride to go as fast as you can in the high desert for 6 hours straight in hopes of breaking a record before you break yourself?
‚Ä¢
The Santa Cruz htSQD share their White Rim Trail FKT @spotify playlists on the Santa Cruz Bicycles Spotify channel - Link In Bio!üëÜ
‚Ä¢
Tobin:
There's really nothing¬†special to my playlist. Double¬†kick drums and some screaming always get me pumped. Most of the music on there would make my mom think there's something wrong with me, which is pretty much on par for a 100-mile all-out effort.
Hit shuffle and let it rip!
‚Ä¢
Alexis:
These are some of¬†my favorite tunes from my high school years. It's mostly a mix of fun music that puts me in a positive mindset mixed with some faster tunes to¬†get me pumped and keep me entertained throughout arduous efforts. There are some guilty pleasures,¬†but who doesn't have those?!
‚Ä¢
Keegan:
Metal and punk rock always gets me fired up to stomp on the pedals, it's my go-to for hard training days and pre-race warm-ups. Every once in a¬†while¬†certain songs would play during the FKT and I'd have to remind myself to turn it down a bit on the pacing to avoid going too deep and risk blowing up.

‚Ä¢
Alexis was a previous owner of the fastest known time on the WRT, and the first women to break the 7hr mark, only to have her record beaten by 16 seconds just a month later.
‚Ä¢
As you might guess, this motivated Alexis to go home, train harder, then come back and take another shot. This time with her new #htSQD teammates in tow.

- UNION -
The Next Generation of DH Talent Under One Awning
‚Ä¢
During this last weird year of racing, and not racing, our friends at @steelcitymedia hatched a plan to bring together a group of young individual riders from around the world under a new ‚ÄòUNION‚Äô banner and then support and nurture that riding talent, while also bringing on and developing new media talent to capture it all.
We were all-inü§ù
‚Ä¢
The crew that‚Äôs assembled for 2021 are riders that we‚Äôve been supporting through our distributors for a few years already, but now they‚Äôre unified under one tent and with room to grow.
The following riders will form the first chapter:
@tuhoto_ariki¬†- NZD
@oliverzwar¬†- SWE
@benzwar¬†- SWE
@finnhb¬†- NZD
@olliedavis.6¬†- AUS
‚Ä¢
This season you can find them based out of Morzine in¬†@bikemorzine¬†supported digs, before traveling to all of the UCI DH World Cups, Crankworx, select EWS races and more.

UNION is also backed by these loyal supporters:

Ep. 4 Tenerife
‚Ä¢
Video link in bioüëÜ
‚Ä¢
Fun Facts: 
Tenerife is basically a massive volcano that rises up out of the Atlantic Ocean. Pico del Teide is 3715 meters high, making it the tallest mountain in Spain, and the perfect trap for storms traveling across the Atlantic. A lot of those clouds get stuck halfway up the mountain creating a ring of green, lush forests around the island. Usually those storms bring rain to the north side, forming jungle like thick rainforests while they keep the South dry and almost desert-like.
With this, there is every type of riding you could ask for, all packed in one little island. Slippery tight tracks in the north jungle, grippy and loamy trails halfway up the mountain, dry and rocky terrain in the south and loose volcanic dirt at the top of Teide mountain.
In one run from the top you can hit at least three different eco systems and track types.

The New Bronson

Why‚Äôd we mix it up?
If you value style at speed or want to have fun feeling fast, then mixed wheels - 29‚Äù up front, 27.5‚Äù out back - are a great way to get there.
The larger front wheel provides more traction and stability that will make you feel more confident squaring off the turns and diving for the inside lines. But a 27.5-inch tire in the rear means this bike still loves getting up on the back wheel and into the air.

So basically, the mixed wheel setup retains the Bronson's whippable character but the gives the bike added traction and stability for hard hitting riding. 

Check out the full #Bronson4 details at the link in our bioüîù

Les Gets appears to be the "not a bike park" track that most riders have been pining for. Fresh, with the potential for some big ruts and more line choices than you can shake a stick at, it's going to be another exciting weekend of racing.

THE SYNDICATE - Les Gets Finals
It was building up to be an epic race on an epic new DH course in Les Gets when it all went sideways as the rain came in and turned the already gnarly track into a battle of survival at speed.
‚Ä¢
Greg was up first and turned in a great run slotting into 7th on an increasingly slick track.
In fact, no one in the top 12 that followed him could go any faster, and his 7th place time held up to the finish.
‚Ä¢
Luca followed right after Greg‚Äôs run and knew he‚Äôd need to push the limits to get as good of a time that was possible on a dryer track earlier in the day, so Luca found that limit‚Ä¶then went past it, crashing in a spot that caused a lot of problems for others.

This time around Ben set out to do something a few others have already done, which is to climb and descend 1,000,000 vertical feet in one year.

Groom is among a new, younger generation of Forest Service officers with a vested interest in new trail construction. In an agency tasked with huge responsibilities, from fire management to watershed restoration, recreation within the Forest Service has historically sat on the back burner. However, Groom prioritizes recreation, saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù to public desires for more trails, and he works to provide more recreational opportunities.

For the most part things did not go according to plan for race #1 of 2 for the @scsyndicate and @nina.hfm96.
‚Ä¢
Even though he‚Äôs nursing a separated shoulder, @gregminnaar decided to suit up anyway and see if he could manage a run in practice, but that quickly turned into a big ‚ÄòNope‚Äô. Now he‚Äôll save his energy to try and take another run at it for race 2 on Saturday.

Although @luca_shaw has a chipped bone in his wrist, he had a great 3rd place quali run and was poised to make some noise in the finals. His race run went fast and smooth, but not as fast as he had hoped, ending up 18th. Definitely will be looking for some redemption in race 2 if he can keep the wrist pain managed.

Today, the Tweed Valley Trails Association is on track to make it even better with the Reservoir Climb trail project, with help from the Santa Cruz Bicycles #PayDirt Fund.

Features:
- High Flow: 3X air flow makes seating tires a snap

Old Enough To Know Better | Rab Wardell | Ep. 1 
‚Ä¢
@rabwardell is striving, fighting, and living his life full of fire and joy. His dreams are still bright, and at 36 his desire to compete at the highest level, and be the best athlete he can be, is a chance for all of us to analyze if we should ever be "old enough to know better‚Äù
‚Ä¢
In the first episode of this four-part series, Rab takes a look back at where it all began, in the foothills of Fife, through to the crushing disappointment of the 2006 commonwealth games, and how that has led to where he is now, including his FKT on the West Highland way in 2020. He begins to ask the question, at 36, should he know better than to risk reliving past pains, or is chasing dreams always worthwhile?

@pinkbike Field Test: 2022 Santa Cruz Blur TR - The Cruz Missile
‚Ä¢
‚ÄúSanta Cruz‚Äôs new Superlight design might look similar to previous versions of VPP but it is very different. It uses a flex pivot in the rear and this means it can go without the associated weight gain that comes with a standard pivot.

The consequence is that, in terms of all-out seat grip, Santa Cruz may have just played a masterstroke. Whereas every new bike release seems to include claims of an increase in anti-squat, Santa Cruz has actually reduced this value on the Blur, as well as tuning the linkage to require a lower spring rate.

One year down, more to come - #htSQD
Five years ago @luca_shaw suited up in his first kit for The Syndicate, a school gym outfit for the infamous 2017 team launch video. And the good times rolled on from there.

Five race seasons later, Luca has pulled on dozens of @scsyndicate race kits, ridden thousands of miles, sprayed gallons¬†of champagne, eaten mountains of @wafflehouseofficial and shared countless hugs and high-fives with his teammates, friends and fans. Syndicate University (#fiveyearplan) has taught him well, and now Luca is ready to roll on to what's next.

So 'tis the season to be jolly stoked about all the good times we've had together.
On behalf of Santa Cruz, the Syndicate and all our partners, we are wishing him the best of luck in his new ventures next season.

Luca, our pit is always open to ya' buddy... you know where we hide the key!üñ§

Old Enough To Know Better | Rab Wardell | Ep. 3 
Live now - Link in bioüëÜ
‚Ä¢
In this episode:
With 11 days until the British XC champs, Rab decides to mix things up. His physical shape is looking good - the numbers don‚Äôt lie - but what about the mental preparations? Riding an indoor skatepark might not seem like ideal preparation for a national xc championship, but as we find out from some esteemed members of his cohort, the fun can be just as beneficial as physical gains.

Old Enough To Know Better | Rab Wardell | Ep.4 - Final Episode
‚Ä¢
This is it. Starting back with his West Highland Way FKT, @rabwardell has now been on an 18 month journey. What started as an idea, and went through various iterations of a fragile reality, has now become a very lucid reality.
Rab will take to the start the line in Plymouth, on a course steeped in UK cycling folklore, against the best the nation has to offer. As the pressure mounts, it‚Äôs important to remember that this a choice, and no matter the outcome, Rab is slowly proving to himself, and others, that dreams, in all their unfiltered chaos, are there to be chased.

Back to normal‚Ä¶ Is what we thought 2021 would be.
Back to big group rides, back to after ride beers, back to big hugs and high-fives, back to seeing all our favorite bands, back to carefree international travel, back to a race season with no cancellations, back to having bike parts come in on boats and trucks without delay‚Ä¶Instead we got back-to-back years of mayhem.
But you know what? We made the most of it, and we are pretty damn stoked with all the good things that happened here in 2021üí•
‚Ä¢
1. Danny doing Danny things. The year started off steep & sketchy as @danny_macaskill & his #5010CC took on the Dubh Slabs on the Isle of Skye. Insane‚õ∞

2. The #htSQD win everything.

Syndicate 2022! 
All The Pieces Fall Into Place.
‚Ä¢¬†
Puzzlin‚Äô ain‚Äôt easy. 
We‚Äôve taken the most successful pieces and added a whole bunch of fresh ones to create the widest ranging yet most interlocking cast of characters and partners the Santa Cruz Syndicate has ever fielded.
‚Ä¢
The mainstays‚Ä¶
Greg Minnaar (RSA): World Champion. Now entering his 24th season of World Cup racing, and 40th year of his full-throttle One Life attitude to time on this planet. The kingpin of puzzling knows how to put it all together like no one else. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs the reigning champ and most prolific male downhill winner we‚Äôll likely ever see.¬†
@gregminnaar
‚Ä¢
Steve Peat (GBR): Head Coach and athlete. Steve‚Äôs deep knowledge of World Cup training, After three decades in the business, this Gandalf of Gravity brings a unique advantage and touch of magic to the team. Just don‚Äôt call him Old Skool, he‚Äôs still damn quick and never shy of a challenge‚Ä¶
@stevepeat
‚Ä¢
And now, NEW for Twenty Two‚Ä¶
‚Ä¢
Laurie Greenland (GBR): on our radar since his junior racing days, the stars over Greenland never quite aligned with those in California until this year. The surfing, skating, bmxing Bristolian is already an accomplished racer and couldn‚Äôt be a better fit for the team.
@lauriegreenland_
‚Ä¢
Nina Hoffmann (GER): prot√©g√© of the Juliana Bicycles program, it‚Äôs hard to imagine ‚ÄúThe Hoff‚Äù has only been racing for such a short time, but Nina‚Äôs trajectory is one of the most inspiring in racing and we‚Äôre proud to be part of it.
@nina.hoff96
‚Ä¢
Jackson Goldstone (CAN): the current Junior World Champion probably still gets jigsaws for his birthday, but Jackson turns 18 this year and is poised to throw a whole box of firecrackers into the Elite ranks in 2023. Until then, Steve and Greg are mentoring the former ‚ÄúSuper Grom‚Äù through another junior season, in preparation for that leap into primetime.
