The longer story:
The folks at @sierratrails do incredible work in the Downieville, Sierra Buttes and surrounding areas building all the amazing trails that are open to the public, but they NEED OUR HELP to keep it going. All proceeds go directly to the Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship to build new trails, and maintain the thousands of feet of trails they have already built.
