| Sundays With Sven |

Everyone’s listened to vinyl records right? You are either old enough that it was part of your youth or young enough that it’s now the hipster thing to do. Growing up I always had an appreciation & fascination for the B sides. They were the meat & potatoes of an album, often featuring the experimental musical wanderings. The A-Side hits got the attention, radio play & paid the bills, but it was the blue collar B sides that would define a band.
-
This post is dedicated to these unsung heros. The B siders, working hard behind the scenes, night & day, early till late. The job is never done nor clearly defined. Despite what their titles & job descriptions suggest the use of their respective tools of the trade is often the easiest & least important ingredient to the Syndicates success. They bring years of knowledge, experience, wisdom & sometimes just rock solid, quick thinking Kiwi ingenuity to the table. I present you Marshy, Laura, PA, Jordi and Joe.
-
Marshy may appear gruff & gritty on the outside but has the biggest heart. When he’s not puzzling with Greg or inventing products, he’s quietly helping out desperate deserving privateers on the side.
-
Laura has the magic healing hands and always knows what the riders need. Rehab, pre race warm ups or post race recovery she keeps them finely tuned.
-
PA was already quite the seasoned traveller & mechanic before he joined the Syndicate to work with fellow Frenchman. Together with Loris they have brainstormed & tested some wild ideas and concepts. Neither afraid to break new ground.
-
Fox’s Jordi, is pretty much family. The yin to Gregs & Loris’ yang. His perpetual patience and  generous sharing of (after hours) cocktails or home-brew make him welcome in the pits anytime.
-
Joe Bowman, has his finger on the pulse and ultimately is the one that makes the boys all look good. Also current reigning Media World Champion.
-
All of the above living proof that every now and then, like Queen’s We Will Rock You there’s a sleeper hit hiding on the B side.
