Return of The Minnaar - Mont Sainte Anne POV 2018
@gregminnaar marks his return to the World Cup circuit since injuring himself before round two, coming back at the infamous Mont Sainte Anne track for his 20th year running... Practice was cancelled until timed training runs due to a huge storm rolling in, closing the lift and leaving a wet and typically gnarly start to proceedings.
