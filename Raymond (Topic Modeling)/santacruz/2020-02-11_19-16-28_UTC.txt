When someone like Greg Williams tells you that you should really hurry up and make an e-bike you pay attention.

Greg has said for a long time that the Lost Sierras is “a big empty space full of empty trails”. Some of these trails have been under the nose of riders for years, they’re just protected by nightmare climbs that deter even the toughest riders. But with the help of a little boost these pieces of singletrack shoot you right from town, fast-forwarding through the torment of 5000ft climbs, to trails like Chimney Rock and Empire Creek - the exact kinds of trails that the title “world’s best downhill trail” was made for.

Heckler makes rare rides the norm, turns climbs into sections of trail to enjoy and it’s still as agile and capable as a regular bike so you can enjoy the really great bits of trail. It was made for places like the Lost Sierras and for adventurous, imaginative riders like Greg Williams.
