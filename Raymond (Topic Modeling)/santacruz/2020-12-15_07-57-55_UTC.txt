Big mountain riding is a nomadic existence. Meeting friends in far flung car parks.  Pinpointing trails you're not sure are even rideable. Sending the ones you know are. Shiny new bling gets battered, shattered and bruised. Thatâ€™s life. Thatâ€™s how it should be. That's why the Nomad exists.

The ever versatile wheel size â€“ 27.5-inch â€“ 170mm travel, a full carbon frame built with the intention that it'll keep running and running, long past the season's end. The Nomad is the kind of bike you need never worry about. Sorry, we can't say the same for the locked public washrooms and parking tickets.
