@lorisvergier goes 5th in Leogang and keeps pace in the overall!⚡️
Another race day of heartbreak for @luca_shaw after qualifying 1st, and being up after the 3rd split, Luca went down in a tight corner, ending his chance for podium. Gutted.
But...you can feel that it’s only a matter of time before these young guns of the @scsyndicate make it to the top step 💪
Val di Sole up next! Can @gregminnaar return from his broken arm in time? Seems unlikely but you can never count that man out🤘
