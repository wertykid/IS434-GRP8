Fun Facts: 
Tenerife is basically a massive volcano that rises up out of the Atlantic Ocean. Pico del Teide is 3715 meters high, making it the tallest mountain in Spain, and the perfect trap for storms traveling across the Atlantic. A lot of those clouds get stuck halfway up the mountain creating a ring of green, lush forests around the island. Usually those storms bring rain to the north side, forming jungle like thick rainforests while they keep the South dry and almost desert-like.
With this, there is every type of riding you could ask for, all packed in one little island. Slippery tight tracks in the north jungle, grippy and loamy trails halfway up the mountain, dry and rocky terrain in the south and loose volcanic dirt at the top of Teide mountain.
In one run from the top you can hit at least three different eco systems and track types.
