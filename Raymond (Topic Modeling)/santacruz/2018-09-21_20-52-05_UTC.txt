After a long, busy year of late nights and many working weekends, today we shut down the Santa Cruz Factory and sent everyone off to go ride their bikes.
Whatever you like, wherever you like, just get out and ride.
In fact, just by posting this pic I’m breaking our own rules. Extra climb punishment forthcoming...
Employees of @SantaCruzBicycles, we salute you✊
