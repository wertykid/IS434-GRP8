| Sundays with Sven

A tall, wise man from Sheffield once said, “Win or lose, we on the booze.” While it may have been slurred in an earlier era; long before coaches, road bike intervals, go pros, nutritionists & trainers changed the face of DH racing, it still holds mostly true today.
•
We’ve already glorified & celebrated the many Syndicate victories in this series but as I’ve priorly postulated, the universe always ensures a degree of balance. The Jedi Knights wouldn’t be so venerated without the Sith Lords. Even our Syndicate Jedi’s take their knocks from time to time & a few battles are lost along the way and sorrows drowned overnight.
•
I’ve seen Steve so bruised & battered, barely able to hobble yet still throws his leg over his bike and sails down the course. It’s the getting back up that counts. His biopic fittingly titled “Won’t Back Down” & by now we’ve all become accustomed to him sinking a few Stellas along the way.
•
Bryceland has had his fair share of hard knocks. Going for broke, literally, on more than one occasion. You would think he would have learnt his YOLO lesson as junior in the infamous Maribor rock garden but in true Ratboy fashion he never changed his riding or approach to life, even when ahead in the biggest race of the year. God Bless The Rat.
•
I’ve witnessed Minnaar dislocate his shoulder entering the Mont St Anne rock garden, carry on & pop his shoulder back in on the exit out. Insane.
But what will forever remain burnt in both my sensor and memory banks is his spectacular crash in Val Di Sole where he folded both himself & bike around a solid pole at near terminal velocity, casually walk it off & after a full bike rebuild still qualify 2nd. Nerves of steel that man & an appetite & instigator when it comes to the liquid gold. He might have even lost his bike once in a French farmers field, never to be found again but that is another story.
•
Loris and Luca both hail from the new school of professional athletes & as such failure usually fuels more stringent training, analysis followed up by a punishing hot road climb or workout, but thankfully even they too let their hair down in true Syndicate spirit now and again.
