Our first rule of 2021 was going to be “Don’t talk about 2020” but the truth is, quite a few good things happened along the way, and our Santa Cruz family really came together to battle the avalanche of chaos that pummeled us all year long. 
•
1. @danny_macaskill with the launch of the first Santa Cruz eBike, the new #Heckler⚡️A lot of excitement and a little controversy ensued😉
•
2. Along with Heckler launch was our first Santa Cruz #PaydirtFund program recipient - @sierratrails for their groundbreaking Connected Communities project👊
•
3. @loosedoglewis keeping it cool at the Andes Pacifico, back when we all still thought we’d be having a ‘normal’ race season. 
•
4. How do you make a bike launch video when you are not allowed to gather a film crew together? The new 5010 launch required us to get creative with our surroundings and turned into what is arguably one of the best MTB oriented short films ever made✌️
•
5. The @world_enduro season ended up being 2 races in total, and the first in🇨🇭was a mess of rain, thunderstorms and ❄️ 
•
6. Nina Hoffmann takes her first elite World Cup DH win in Maribor! What a run by @nina.hfm96 🙌
•
7. @scsyndicate makes the most of a short but exciting World Cup season by almost winning every race in the series with @lorisvergier 1st in both races in Maribor and @gregminnaar winning race 1 & just barely edged out in race 2 in Portugal. The Syndicate also won the @uci_mountainbike DH Team Overall🏆Not bad for a season that was in danger of not happening at all.
•
8. The launch of the new #Bullit⚡️with speedruns and sound effects by @lorisvergier🗣
•
9. When ‘Everesting’ became a pandemic pastime for solo cyclists looking to complete a personal challenge, @benhildred significantly raised the bar with his olympusmons.cc project to climb the equivalent of the height of the tallest mountain in our solar system, and rode his Santa Cruz Tallboy 21,635 Meters (70,980ft) in 3 days🤯
•
10. Launch of the new #Nomad5. More travel than a white van, & the perfect travel companion for @right__hand_sam who was joined along the way by a formidable cast of characters🤘
•
Goodbye 2020☣️
And cheers to all of you for getting through it with us🖤
