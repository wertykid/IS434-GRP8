Mayhem on the Mountain - Snowshoe World Cup DH 1
•
For the most part things did not go according to plan for race #1 of 2 for the @scsyndicate and @nina.hfm96.
•
Even though he’s nursing a separated shoulder, @gregminnaar decided to suit up anyway and see if he could manage a run in practice, but that quickly turned into a big ‘Nope’. Now he’ll save his energy to try and take another run at it for race 2 on Saturday.
•
Although @luca_shaw has a chipped bone in his wrist, he had a great 3rd place quali run and was poised to make some noise in the finals. His race run went fast and smooth, but not as fast as he had hoped, ending up 18th. Definitely will be looking for some redemption in race 2 if he can keep the wrist pain managed.
•
@nina.hfm96 had a unfortunate close encounter with a tree and another smaller crash on her race run leading to a DNF. Sore but not injured, Nina’s excited to get back out there and ready for Race 2✌️
