If there’s somebody who has seen & done it all in racing; its Doug “Hattrick” Hatfield. Tuning and tweaking on bikes is part of his DNA, from building his first MTB in the 70’s (before you could buy them) while still in high school, to working as a full time tech for the US National and Olympic team in the early nineties before moving on to big factory race teams. He’s worked in road, track, XC, trials & CX before joining Santa Cruz in 2002 and has been heading up Syndicate’s team support since 2006. During that time he’s wrenched for every single rider that’s worn the syndicate stripes, forever the constant & always with a smile and positive infectious attitude that lightens up the pits.

There are little tricks, secrets & personal touches that every good mechanic has up their sleeve, but few exude a peaceful, caring & calming aura like Dougie Fresh. I’ve witnessed Minnaar make a last minute decision, while sat in a wet Fort William start gate, to back his pedal pins out a turn for a little extra grip. Doug without panic or fluster magically produces the correct allen and gets the job done with seconds to spare. He’s that rock you want in your corner.
-
He will build the perfect wheel in under 20 minutes but he will go the extra mile to break in a fresh set of bearings too. Run in bearings roll faster and you can sometimes spot him spinning out the bearings with a high speed drill to conjure up those few extra milliseconds for his rider.  Sometimes there’s a personal message or an old lucky number board hidden behind the current one, or a fun custom sticker lurking somewhere on the frame that makes all the difference. Experienced hands, some zen wisdom and a stoked happy rider make for a winning package.

After thirty years of wrenching Dougie returns for another year as Service Course Manager, a full time job staying on top of the mundane (parts and spares, forecasting, ordering & packing) while still bringing the magic with his forever youthful spark and enthusiasm.
