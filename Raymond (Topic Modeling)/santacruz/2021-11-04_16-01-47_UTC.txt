A tech video on a tubeless valve?! Trust us, you are going to want to check this one out - The new Fillmore valve by @reservewheels

Our friends over at Reserve are rewriting the future of tubeless systems with the introduction of their new Fillmore valve, a completely new take on tubeless valve designs. 
The patented Reserve Fillmore valve represents a leap forward in technology, with a design that eliminates the traditional, delicate, clog-inciting presta valve core of yesteryear.

Features:
- High Flow: 3X air flow makes seating tires a snap
- No Clog: Patented poppet-style design eliminates clogging by shielding air hole from contact with sealant
- Direct-Inject: Coreless design for no-fuss injection of sealant
- Micro-Adjust: Airs down to the perfectly dialed tire pressure
