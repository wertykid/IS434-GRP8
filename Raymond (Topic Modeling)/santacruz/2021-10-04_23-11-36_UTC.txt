Crossing It Up

Man of many talents - @mctubbbin - went straight from placing 5th at the 4 day @transcascadia blind enduro, 3,000 miles across the country to Baltimore, Maryland to start his Cyclocross season with back to back races at @charmcitycx

With no UCI points yet Tobin had to start at the back of the pack both days and moved his way up to 18th both days. Looking forward to the next one! Maybe with a little more rest this time👌
