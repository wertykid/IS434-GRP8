And also how NOT to build an awesome track on public land🤦🏻

“It's always good to learn from your mistakes and if you can help others to avoid making the same mistakes then that's all the better. I invested so much time and energy into the build and realistically, the trail could have been closed down without the interventions that happened. Building without the landowners permission is illegal – that is a fact” - Ben Cathro
