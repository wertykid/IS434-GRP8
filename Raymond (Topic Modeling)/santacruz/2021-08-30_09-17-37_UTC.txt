Still buzzing from yesterday’s epic events in Val di Sole🏆

Greg winning his 4th World Championship title and his 11th Worlds medal overall is something that is pretty hard to fathom.
That’s a whole lot of hardware colllected and champagne spilled🍾 🍾🍾🍾
It’s quite the list:
- 2001🥉
- 2003🥇
- 2004🥈
- 2005🥉
- 2006🥈
- 2009🥈
- 2010🥉
- 2012🥇
- 2013🥇
- 2015🥈
- 2021🥇
And we get the feeling he’s not done yet…🤙

Adding to the excitement was Luca laying down a scorcher of a run to take 10th overall💥
