It’s in the details where the New Stigmata really shines. 
We loved the previous version so the core DNA is still in there, but the addition of 650b/700c wheel compatibility, increased tire clearance, fender mounts, a 3rd bottle cage mount, threaded BB, flat mount brakes, stealth dropper post compatibility, all in a redesigned chassis with increased compliance highlight the Stigmata’s ever-widening scope of purpose.
