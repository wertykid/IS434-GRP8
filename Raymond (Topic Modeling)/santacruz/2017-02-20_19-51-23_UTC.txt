@ac_fabz loaded up the van, gathered up some of the @santacruzfactoryracing crew and headed for Ashland, Oregon for a trail building weekend with some local friends the fine folks at @ashlandmountainadventures 
The results shown here are part of the #Jabberwalkie2 trail they all worked on. Can't wait to ride this trail in the spring!
