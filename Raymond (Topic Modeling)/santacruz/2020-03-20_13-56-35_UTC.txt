@vitalmtb Winning Bike - Brady Stone’s Santa Cruz Megatower.
•
Last week down in New Zealand (Right as mayhem was hitting us here in Santa Cruz) @bradystone13 took home the U21 win at the EWS qualifier - Mammoth Enduro - in Nelson, NZ.
Brady’s time also happened to be the fastest on the day in the Elite, beating some of the top names in the EWS.
Nice one Brady!
