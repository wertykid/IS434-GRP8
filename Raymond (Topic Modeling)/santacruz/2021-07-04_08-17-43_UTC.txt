THE SYNDICATE - Les Gets Finals
It was building up to be an epic race on an epic new DH course in Les Gets when it all went sideways as the rain came in and turned the already gnarly track into a battle of survival at speed.
â€¢
Greg was up first and turned in a great run slotting into 7th on an increasingly slick track.
In fact, no one in the top 12 that followed him could go any faster, and his 7th place time held up to the finish.
â€¢
Luca followed right after Gregâ€™s run and knew heâ€™d need to push the limits to get as good of a time that was possible on a dryer track earlier in the day, so Luca found that limitâ€¦then went past it, crashing in a spot that caused a lot of problems for others. 
c'est la vie!
â€¢
Final results:
@gregminnaar - 7th
5th in the overall
@luca_shaw - 52nd with the crash
39th in the overall

Now a bit of a break for the Syndicate before the next World Cup race in MariborðŸ¤™
