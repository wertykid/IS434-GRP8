Today is â€˜Ride Your Bike Dayâ€™ here at Santa Cruz.
Itâ€™s a company-wide paid day off to go ride your bike. 
While most of us headed for the sweet Sierra singletrack of Downieville, CA, it really doesnâ€™t matter where or what you ride as long as you get out there and remember why we do this whole damn thing in the first place.

Enjoy your ride hard-working employees of @santacruzbicyclesðŸ›
