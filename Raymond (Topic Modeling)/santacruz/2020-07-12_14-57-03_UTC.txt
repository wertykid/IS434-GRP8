In the 80’s every skateboarder's dream was to move to California, get sponsored and turn pro. It was my dream and it was Rob Roskopp’s dream. Dreams we were both able to fulfill, albeit with different degrees of success; Rob had one of the all-time best selling skate decks, while I was eating 2-minute noodles & hitchhiking around California, living the dream.
As fate would have it, our paths briefly crossed one night in 1992 at a downtown San Jose skate park. 10 years older than me, Rob was already hooked on bikes and in the planning stages with Santa Cruz Bicycles, which he launched soon after. Star struck then, it took me another 10 years before I found bikes and as they say, the rest is history.

The point of my story is that the roots run deep with both Santa Cruz and The Syndicate. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly what makes both so successful, but it is certainly more than just the sum of the parts. Wild, all risking rebellious abandon juxtaposed with savant-like determination, practice and perfection. All traits & pathways to success, be it in skateboarding, running a company, or becoming a top downhill racer. Rob has built more than a brand, he has built a family and a following.

I figured out pretty early on with The Syndicate any conundrum can be overcome by either a statement or a question - It’s either a DTR “Don’t tell Rob” when maybe a rental car gets damaged, or WWRD “What would Rob do?” when you are wondering whether to splash out on another round of celebratory drinks on the team credit card.
•
What I have seen most since I’ve got to know Rob better, is that The Syndicate is more than a line item to him. It’s his love & his family. His heart and soul are fully invested. Never resting, even when winning, he’s the driving force in R&D in the off season, and when racings back on you will find him in the mud trackside during training. Then getting the party started in the pits when there’s celebrating to be done.

Having roots in skateboarding doesn’t automatically buy you street cred, but it sure does rub off when building one of the most iconic bike racing teams in history - The Syndicate.
