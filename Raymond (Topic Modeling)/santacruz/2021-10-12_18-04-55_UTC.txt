Santa Cruz Bronson V4 Review - The Goldilocks Bike? - @theloamwolf
•
“Our first ride impressions back at the start of Summer had us extremely excited to put some serious mileage and elevation into the Bronson v4, and we’ve come out the other side grinning just as hard as that initial honeymoon period had left us. Santa Cruz has done an impressive job at finding a perfect middle ground between the 5010’s playfulness and the Hightower’s desire to go fast, and the result is an absolute riot of a machine that’ll shred it all”
