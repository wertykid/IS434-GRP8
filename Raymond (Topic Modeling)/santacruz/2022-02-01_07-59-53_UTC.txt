The New Heckler
Further. Higher. Faster.
â€¢
The new Heckler is actually two all-new bikes, one has dual 29-inch wheels and the second has mixed wheels. The full 29" version feels calm at speed and efficient across varied terrain. The mixed wheel version blends traction with quicker steering. 
â€¢
The new larger 720wh interchangeable battery allows riders to expand their own trail map - accessing previously unreachable trails, unlocking less-used trails and cramming more fun into less time.
