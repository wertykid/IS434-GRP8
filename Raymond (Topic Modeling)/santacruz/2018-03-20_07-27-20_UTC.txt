THE NEW HIGHBALL
On paper it’s a whip-cracking alternative to the new Blur; the racer’s hardtail for high intensity assaults. But settle down for a long haul and it’s immediately clear the Highball is at home in a range of cross country environments from XC sprints to 24-hour sufferfests.
The Highball is available for order in Carbon C and CC now, and begins shipping immediately.
