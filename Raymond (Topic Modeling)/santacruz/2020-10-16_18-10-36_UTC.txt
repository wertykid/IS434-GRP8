What a day in Maribor for THE SYNDICATE!
•
Loris takes the win, Greg on the podium in 5th, Luca less than a second behind in 6th.
•
The track was wet, the mud was slippery, the rocks were treacherous, but the Syndicate crew stayed on top of their game🙌
•
No rest for the wicked-fast, as they all prepare for WC#2 quali’s tomorrow and race on Sunday.
A crazy year gets crazier...🏆
