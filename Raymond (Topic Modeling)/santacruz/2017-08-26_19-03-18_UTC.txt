Not the race we'd hoped for in Val di Sole, as @gregminnaar's rear tire went flat while up at the 2nd split by 1.4 seconds, costing him the overall points lead. Still an amazing season for the guys, and the big positives on the day were @lorisvergier with a blaming fast run taking 4th & @luca_shaw 8th. Bring on Worlds!
