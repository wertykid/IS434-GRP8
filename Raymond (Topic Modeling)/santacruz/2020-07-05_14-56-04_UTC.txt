| Sundays With Sven

When I was a kid my dad used to take me to watch cricket. Now cricket is nothing like baseball. It drags on for five days and sometimes even then there is no winner. What I remember most from those long hot days under the sun was that the fans were often more interesting than the game itself especially in the afternoons when the beers had been flowing for a few hours, giving the streakers the dutch courage needed to liven up the game a little.
While cricket and DH Racing are polar opposites the spirit of the fans remains the same.

Being a true fan is a proper sport in itself and one that can be every bit as serious as the racing it follows. Big crowds and loud fans can transform a good World Cup into a great one come finals day. The deafening electrifying atmosphere in the finish bowl gives me goosebumps, elevating my heart rate and raising the hair on my arms, my own endomorphic spike raising the stakes that much more and only ever felt on finals day at a select few races.

Fort William is legendary for its fan turnout and their dedicated passion, no matter what the weather. They will walk the track from top to bottom dressed in all sorts of outfits each year waving sharpie scrawled cardboard signs professing their loyalty to their favourite riders in some fitting and witty way Other iconic venues like Mt St Anne, Val Di Sole, Andorra, Lenzerheide and Leogang all have sardine filled finish areas and the French fans, well they are hard to beat, they are as crazy about cycling as they are over the Syndicate. The Aussie fans are there for the party and will bury beer and Bundy filled eskies weeks before a venue is fenced off. South Africa fields a loud, large and dedicated One Life Crew, cursedly armed with vuvuzelas, that will mysteriously  pop up on the other side of the world en masse whenever Greg wins a race. Then there is a long time Syndicate fan who is so committedly all in that he has to go by the pseudonym “Ivan” to protect his real identity.

Without the fans racing is simply not the same. Hopefully I have more than cricket to look forward to in the near future.
