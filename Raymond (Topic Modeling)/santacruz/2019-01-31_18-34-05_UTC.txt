Big shout out to Cedric Gracia as he moves on from Santa Cruz to work on new projects and opportunities.

We appreciate the energy CG has poured into everything we have done together. We've shared a wild ride, and the long list of good times is stained with his blood, sweat and champagne. 
We wish him the best in his future endeavours, and remember that this is definitely not goodbye as he will always be welcome here as part of the Santa Cruz family for life.
Cheers CG!🍻
