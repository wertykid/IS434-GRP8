Mission: Olympus Mons Day 03 - Mission Critical
Looting Interants and a Return to Home
•
“I'd earned a proper night's sleep after the second day – a whole seven whole hours. I started later, not on the road until 4am. This was it, only 7200m to go. Only.

The temperature change from bottom to the base building of the ski fields was a real wake up call, flashbacks of the day before were filling my head and clouding my defensive wall of positive, determined thoughts. I'd strategically placed my favorite Misspent Summers (very apt) jumper at the bottom as something to look forward to. But it disappeared around lap two, likely pinched by the occupants of an overflowing, shaggy looking campervan, the only people I saw that morning. That frustration got me up lap three.

The whole @vertigo_bikes_queenstown crew and friends joined me for the last lap. The weather took an abysmal turn for the worst half way up. We were riding in hail and head winds. The end was in sight but we couldn't see much through the cloud we found ourselves in. Thank you to everyone who came out for laps over the past three days. It really helped.

My 72 hours went great. My bike was faultless and my body although exhausted was not devastated. I chose to run the Tallboy for its efficiency, seating position and stability, even when I wasn’t so stable. Running the effortless and reliable SRAMS AXS groupset gave one less thing to worry about. Coupled with my flat pedals, 34 tooth chainring and lack of chamois I had a winning combo.

I can now tick this one off, and more importantly share it with the cycling community. Being the admin of the OlympusMons.cc site I’m excited to see other efforts. I’d hope these daft rides inspire some of you to set your own goals. Mountain biking can be gnarly in so many ways, whether for that endorphin or adrenalin buzz. What a sick, sick sport......What’s next?”
