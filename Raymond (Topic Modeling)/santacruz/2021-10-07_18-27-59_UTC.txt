The New Chameleon
â€¢
Five Riders Rides #2 - Swaneeâ€™s Patinated Aluminum Pariah
â€¢
Swanee Ravonison used to own a bike shop and spent all her spare time welding her own bikes on the side. 
Now she focuses full time on her bike company called @atelierpariah where she builds custom bikes that are meant for escaping the city and finding space in nature. 
She took the Chameleon and stripped it "of his flashy dress" and some of the bike's techy components to make it purer for the kinds of bikepacking Swanee enjoys.
