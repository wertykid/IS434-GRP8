White Rim//FKT Playlists - Echoes In The Pain Cave
•
What music do you queue up when you are about to head out on a self supported ride to go as fast as you can in the high desert for 6 hours straight in hopes of breaking a record before you break yourself?

The Santa Cruz htSQD share their White Rim Trail FKT @spotify playlists on the Santa Cruz Bicycles Spotify channel - Link In Bio!👆

Tobin:
There's really nothing special to my playlist. Double kick drums and some screaming always get me pumped. Most of the music on there would make my mom think there's something wrong with me, which is pretty much on par for a 100-mile all-out effort.
Hit shuffle and let it rip!

Alexis:
These are some of my favorite tunes from my high school years. It's mostly a mix of fun music that puts me in a positive mindset mixed with some faster tunes to get me pumped and keep me entertained throughout arduous efforts. There are some guilty pleasures, but who doesn't have those?!

Keegan:
Metal and punk rock always gets me fired up to stomp on the pedals, it's my go-to for hard training days and pre-race warm-ups. Every once in a while certain songs would play during the FKT and I'd have to remind myself to turn it down a bit on the pacing to avoid going too deep and risk blowing up.
