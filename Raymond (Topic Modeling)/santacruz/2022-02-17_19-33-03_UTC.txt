Hot on the heels of the V10 taking the @mtbnews user awards Best DH Bike, 2 of our V10 pilots take Mountain Biker of the Year awards with Nina Hoffman 1st in Women and Greg Minnaar 2nd in Men 🙌
We’d be more upset that the reigning DH World Champion didn’t take the No. 1 men’s spot, but that award went to Santa Cruz family member Danny MacAskill👍
Huge congratulations to all 3! 🤝
