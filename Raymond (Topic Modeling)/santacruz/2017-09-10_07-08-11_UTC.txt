World Champs SPOILER ALERT 
Not the day we were hoping for in Cairns, but damn are we are proud of these guys. 
A great looking run lead to a 7th place finish for @lorisvergier.

An unfortunate slide out in the loose corner at the bottom of the rock garden ended @luca_shaw's chances at a medal but he got back on his bike and still finished in 26th.

@gregminnaar had another spectacular run going and was only 0.3 down at the first split, when his rear tire went flat for the second race in a row. This one was the hard, as Greg's run was looking so good and we all know how strong of a peddler he can be at the bottom of a course where that is what can make-it or break-it. Just not meant to be this time around. 
Hard to believe the 2017 DH season is over, but we are already looking forward to 2018. The boys will be back...with a vengeance. 
Big thanks to all of our sponsors, and everyone that helps make THE SYNDICATE the best team on dirt.
