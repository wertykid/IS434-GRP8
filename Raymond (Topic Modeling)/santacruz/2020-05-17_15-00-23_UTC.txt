Greg Minnaar and Fort William are two downhill icons that have truly stood the test of time. As permanent stop on the World Cup circuit since 2002, Greg‚Äôs grabbed 11 podiums and a record breaking 7 wins here, 6 of them on board the Syndicate powered V10. You could say it‚Äôs a match made in heaven even though it feels more like hell out there at times.

Whipping wind, rain, sleet and hail on the upper reaches leaves you exposed with nowhere to hide, Greg is one of the best at carrying speed here. Before you can find shelter in the midge infested woods you have to navigate the fastest and longest bedrock section on any World Cup track. Greg's lankiness and ability to find the smoothest lines, combined with the V10‚Äôs extra travel is hard to match here. It‚Äôs a roll of the dice on how the woods are taped, one of the few bits of track to change each year. Then it‚Äôs the drag race down the motorway powering and tucking over the jumps (Greg's speciality) before being welcomed by the biggest and loudest crowd gathered in any finish arena come rain or shine each year. It‚Äôs one of the only venues where I still get goosebumps when it comes down to the final few riders. Something everyone needs to experience at least once. A gathering of clans for the mountain bike fans.

The loudest cheers are usually reserved for hometown heroes and royalty (Peaty), Minnaar is one of the few outlanders who brings them to their feet. Ever since embarking on his racing career based in the UK, he has a special affinity with the British fans who have welcomed him as their own. After recently pledging allegiance to the Queen and receiving a British passport, the question is who will receive knighthood first, Greg or Steve?
