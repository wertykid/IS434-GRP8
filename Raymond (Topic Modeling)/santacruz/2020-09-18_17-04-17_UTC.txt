Review: Bike Mag 2020 Bible - Santa Cruz 5010👍
•
“By the time we rolled away from the trailhead, the 5010 was already the undisputed parking lot champ of the test, and the good times just kept rolling throughout our test lap. This bike has a way of inviting you to jib, skid and wheelie like you’re a high schooler ditching class to go ride. It’s nothing but fun.”
