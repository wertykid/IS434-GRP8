@bikemag - The Most Influential Bikes of the Decade - 2013 Santa Cruz Bronson
•
“The Bronson was a do-it-all, for-the-fun-of-it play bike. It wasn't committed to any one style of riding, rather it just wanted to be out on the trail having a good time. It jumped well, pedaled well, cornered well and, well, did just about everything well. And that was what most people loved about the Bronson—it didn't matter what kind of rider you were, you'd probably have a lot of fun on it.  Santa Cruz convinced the public that 27.5 wheels worked and, soon after its release, most of the other big-name brands started churning out their own 27.5 creations”
