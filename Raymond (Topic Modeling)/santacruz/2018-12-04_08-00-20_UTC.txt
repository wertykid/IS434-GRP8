A project two years in the making, THE NEW V10 has arrived! 
But wait, there are two?!
Oh yes...as we developed the V10.29er race bike for the @SCSyndicate, it became apparent that not all riders would fit on or prefer the 29” bike, so we made a 27.5 bike, too. To be clear, it's two completely different frames—the production versions of both bikes were developed in parallel, and they’re both the recipients of two seasons of high-level suspension testing and tuning under the Syndicate.
