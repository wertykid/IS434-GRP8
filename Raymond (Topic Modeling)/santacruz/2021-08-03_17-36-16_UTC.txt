Ben Hildred Rides One Million Vertical Feet in 200 Days🔝
•
You might remember @benhildred from his insane ‘Everesting’ one-up, the Olympus Mons challenge of climbing the equivalent height of the tallest mountain in the solar system (2.5 times taller than Everest) in 72hrs. We believe Ben is still the only one to complete this challenge (details at olympusmons.cc)
•
This time around Ben set out to do something a few others have already done, which is to climb and descend 1,000,000 vertical feet in one year. 
But then Ben decided to one-up that as well by completing it in only 200 days, averaging 5,000 feet (1524m) a day over the course of the challenge. 🤯
