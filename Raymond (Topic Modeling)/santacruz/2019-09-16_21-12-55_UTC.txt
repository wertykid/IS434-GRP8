The World Cup season may have ended in West Virginia, but with one more chance for an elite level DH race, the @scsyndicate headed 2,500 miles west to the sunny skies, big rocks and super dusty trails of Snow Summit Resort in Southern California for the @foxusopenmtb🇺🇸
•
@lorisvergier was in attendance, and sat out the race still nursing his injury from Worlds, but @gregminnaar & @luca_shaw had a great showing with 2nd and 4th overall.

Shout out to SoCal local @colepicchiottino who who finished 3rd overall to make it 3 out of the top five Pros on Santa Cruz #V1029ers🤘
