THE SYNDICATE - Lenzerheide
@gregminnaar never ceases to amaze...
Less than a second back from the win on a run that was thought to be untouchable, Greg gained time on the whole bottom half of the course but ran out of track, finishing in 2nd.
He’ll take it, but after two 2nd place finishes this season, both by only 10ths of a second, Greg is hungry for another World Cup victory to add to his all-time lead of 21 WC DH wins. #GOAT 🐐
