Santa Cruz is proud to announce sponsorship of the 2018 French National DH Championships in Morzine from July 26-28, 2018.

Working in partnership with the Morzine-Avoriaz Tourism Office and the Pleney Lift Company, Santa Cruz is helping develop a brand new DH track for the occasion, on the legendary Pleney mountain.

Syndicate rider @lorisvergier will be there to compete for National honors with the full backing of his @scsyndicate team.  For the past few seasons, teammates @gregminnaar and @luca_shaw have used Morzine as their home from home for training and, erm, not training. Meanwhile team mentor @stevepeat has even taken up residency!
