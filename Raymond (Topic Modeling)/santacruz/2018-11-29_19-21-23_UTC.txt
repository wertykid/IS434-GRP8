Here are some nice photos of the #StigmataCC show bike we used for the @chriskingbuzz Open House back in October, now nicely fitted with the new CK DropSet
Groupset is @rideshimano Ultegra Disc.
The carbon rims are actually our #CarbonReserve 29er 25mm XC rims laced to a CK R45 rear and MTB front hub so maybe a bit stiffer and burlier than needed for this bike, but I couldn’t help myself👌. Tires are @maxxisbike Ravager 40c and the saddle is @MashSF team issue Selle Italia Flite👍
