#Singletrack6 Day 2
Alex McGuiness here - aka @krunk_shox - grabbed his #TallboyCC and drove the 15 hours from the thin air of Winter Park, CO to the high, dry Western Kootenay's of BC for the Singletrack6. On day 1 he finished 12th in the GC but also won the timed descent. In typical Krunk fashion he's taking a casual approach to proceedings until he gets on his bike, which is when he turns up the heat. The temperature and very low humidity is really testing riders and the dry, rocky, surprisingly technical (surprisingly for those not familiar with XC racing in BC) trails has meant racers are digging deep already. With 2 days down and 4 to go it could be a battle of attrition as well as ambition.
