And The Winner Is
•
@sierratrails has announced the winner of a brand new Hightower and Trailbuilder's Delight package in this year's 5 Bucks a Foot fundraiser and the winner is......(enter excessively long American Idol-like pause)....Lewis Stockton of Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada! Congrats Lewis, we know you'll put that Hightower along with the @evocsports Trail Builder pack, a Trail Boss trail tool and @patagonia Work Wear gear to good use.

Said Lewis upon receiving the news, “I’m honestly speechless! Thank you so much not just for the bike but for building all the awesome trails and making mountain biking the amazing sport it is!”
A grand total of $55,496 was raised in this year's 5 Bucks a Foot with 2,321 donors, and all proceeds will go to funding a number of different trails projects we have going in the Lost Sierra region, including the new Beckwourth Peak Trail in Portola, California. We couldn't make #dirtmagic happen without all of your most generous support.

A HUGE thanks to everyone that donated. Even if you didn’t win, new trails WILL BE BUILT because of your help 🙌
