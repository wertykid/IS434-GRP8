A rough qualifying day for The Syndicate. After the news of @luca_shaw’s broken collarbone, @gregminnaar & @lorisvergier set out on what seemed like a routine qualifying day, but as the rain came in things got unpredictable and Greg went down and got his fork all twisted-up leading to a 63rd place finish.
Greg’s first time falling outside of the qualifying cut in 20 years of World Cup racing...an unbelievable stat all on its own, showing how consistent and dominant Greg has been for his whole career 🐐.
Loris kept it pinned and upright to finish 5th in qualifying are is ready to fly the @scsyndicate flag solo on race day. He’s primed and ready🤘
