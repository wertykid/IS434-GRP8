The @santacruzfactoryracing crew headed up to the @usacycling #CyclocrossNationalChampionships2019 in Lakewood, WA and had a cold, muddy, exhaustingly-good time🇺🇸

Tobin #newschool Ortenblad placed 14th in Men’s Elite, Scott #midschool Chapin with 6th in Men’s 35-39 & Justin #oldschool Robinson on the podium with 2nd overall in Men’s 45-49⚡️⚡️⚡️

Justin and Chapin also raced the single-speed class with Justin finishing 13th overall, and Chapin starting in the 149th spot, then passing 124 riders to finish 25th overall. Hardcore🤘
