Continuing our V10.7 development story from yesterday, here is our senior industrial designer @dogbox’s incredible custom #V1029er.

“The V10 7 29 was the first Santa Cruz DH bike were I was part of the design team. Downhill has always been my favorite type of riding, and to be able to lead the industrial design for such a legendary DH bike was a something special. I knew I would want a personal V10 29 after riding the engineering test bikes, and it would be cool to have a unique paint job for my bike. 
A few years ago I was at the National Championship Air Race in Reno and saw Planes of Fame's P51-A Miss Virginia. Not to be confused with the Packard built Merlin powered P51-D, Miss Virginia is a P51-A powered by Allison. Also flying still is the AAF's B-25 ‘Executive Sweet’ with this same livery of the 1st Air Commando Group. I figured this livery would look pretty cool on a V10.”
