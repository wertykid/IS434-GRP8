Santa Cruz Area Locals!
This Friday Dec 1st at 7pm in our factory showroom we will be showing the short film This Way Up which chronicles our friend Andy McKenna’s pharma-free face-off with Multiple Sclerosis while trying to continue to live the life that he and his wife Aneela have built around guiding MTB tours in his homeland of Scotland.
Swipe right for all the details. 
We’ll provide the free beverages, you provide the $5 donation to support the @stokedonms cause. 
It’s a moving and ultimately uplifting story that reminds you to live the good life...and to go ride your bike.
