Highs & lows for the @scsyndicate in Fort William today as @lorisvergier takes 2nd ⚡️👍which also places him 2nd in the overall just 4 points out of 1st!
Hard day for @luca_shaw after qualifying 1st and definitely being he man to beat this weekend, Luca had a flat after being up at the first split ending his chances all too quickly💔
The silver lining is that Luca’s great start to the  season still has him in 6th in the overall & only 47 points back 👌
Bring on Leogang!
