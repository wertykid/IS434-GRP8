Was going to post about the 2020 @transcascadia registration going live, but since it sold out in less than 12 hours(!), I’ll post our favorite image from one of last summer’s Trans Cascadia trail building days (aka-“Work Parties”) that anyone can sign up for, whether you are racing or not, at trans-cascadia.com
See you there!
