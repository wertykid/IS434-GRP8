| 2019 @TransProvence Day Six - This Is The End |

“After six days and ten years of racing and traversing the southern Alps from mountain tops to the Mediterranean Sea the Trans-Provence has come to a close, and not just for the 2019 edition, but forever. This is a tough pill to swallow; tougher than all the hike-a-bikes and switchbacks over the years!...”
