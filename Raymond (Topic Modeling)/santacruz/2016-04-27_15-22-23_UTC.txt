Behind the music with @songhoyblues - The idea behind the #Tallboy3 video was to bring together two of South Africa’s greatest mountain biking exports; downhill racer @gregminnaar and the Absa @capeepic MTB stage race. But the African connection didn’t stop there. The music track on the video - Al Hassidi Terei - is the work of a great band called Songhoy Blues from Mali, West Africa pictured above. 
The group is also one of the principal subjects of the powerful documentary film - They Will Have To Kill Us First - which chronicles Malian musicians‚ fight with the extremist forces that have seen music banned in much of the country. Read the full story in the news section of our website.
