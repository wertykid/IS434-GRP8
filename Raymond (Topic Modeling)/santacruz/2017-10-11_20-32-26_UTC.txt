Our engineering tech here at the Santa Cruz Factory - @kiran.mackinnon - was rewarded for his excellent 2017 race season (Including a World Cup 15th place in Mont-Sainte-Anne, and 5th in the Air DH at Crankworx/Whistler) with a new DH test bike....an unobtanium #V1029er.
As you can plainly see, Kiran's pretty stoked.
Swipe through for all the big wheeled goodness!
