Nomadic Weekend Away 2021
â€¢
More than 50 riders joined @jamienicolladventures for his annual #NomadicWeekendAway at That Place MTB Park about 20 kms outside of  Whanganui on the North Island of New Zealand.
â€¢
Jamie loaded up his 1960 Bedford bus and provided the campsites, daily ride-outs, camp-side beers, a nomadic style dinner, nightly slide shows, and more.
â€¢
Built on 50 Hectares of Oskam Family trust land, That Place is run by Tom Oskam and Michaella â€˜Macâ€™ Laird and boasts 9 tracks with more being built.
â€¢
Pretty much sounds like an MTB dream right now as most of us are closing in on a full year of restricted travel and very small friend and family circles. Canâ€™t wait to get back to the good timesâ€¦
See you next year Jamie!
