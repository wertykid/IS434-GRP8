This is @nicbean_ . If you demoed a bike from the Factory here in Santa Cruz recently, there‚Äôs a good chance Nic was the one who set up your ride for you. 
In 2017 Nic raced with the EWS team at Aspen and Whistler but this year he‚Äôs making a go for the overall; the Jr. World Champ title. The EWS made a new rule for 2018 that only the best five finishes of eight races will count for the Junior Overall; financially this is great for up and coming riders as it allows them to compete on the world stage.
Nic finished 18th in a field of 70 Juniors at @world_enduro Round 3 in France, which is a good start to see what he can do this season, and we are super excited to see what comes next...High-Five Nic! üñê
