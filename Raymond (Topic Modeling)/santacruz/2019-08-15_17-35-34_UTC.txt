There’s a new #ReserveCarbon rim in town and it’s our largest & widest rim yet.
Introducing the Reserve 37 29”
•
Plus-curious, but not willing to commit to an ultra-wide rim that’ll square off the swathe of 2.6 tires popping out of molds around the world? The Reserve 37mm width is optimized for tires from 2.5 to 2.8 inches wide, and will still support a 3.0 nicely, if that’s your preference.

Available starting today👌
