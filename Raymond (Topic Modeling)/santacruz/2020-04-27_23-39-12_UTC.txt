Santa Cruz R&D Lab PPE Project Update -
Working split shifts, 7 days a week, our carbon lab employees and volunteers have currently produced and shipped 3,000 face shields with 12,000 more on the way. 
What’s really nice is to see them already in the hands of first responders that have been helping mountain bikers for years in some of our favorite riding spots - Downieville, Sierra City, Graeagle, Quincy and more, thanks to our friends at @sierabuttes & @lureresort 👍
We have also teamed up with our neighbors over at @ibiscycles to be able to essentially double the shield cut production and get them out quicker. Huge high-five to everyone involved!
