While #htSQD teammate @alexisskarda was taking the national marathon title over the weekend in Maryland, @mctubbbin was grabbing more @uci_cycling cyclocross points while playing in the Midwest mud at the @kings_cx cyclocross race in Cincinnati, Ohio in perfect cyclocross conditions🌧
Tobin’s feeling like his CX legs are coming back, and finished 6th on both days🙌
Now he’s headed home to Santa Cruz for some @surfcitycx racing 🌊
Looking forward to seeing his Halloween race day costume💀
