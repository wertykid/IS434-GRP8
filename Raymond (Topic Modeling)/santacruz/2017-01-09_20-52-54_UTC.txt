Wise words from Tobin Ortenblad / @mctubbbin - "It's funny how self expectation fluctuates throughout a race season. Coming into this year's cross season if you'd have told me I'd place fifth as a first year Elite at US cyclocross nationals, I would've been thrilled. After an incredible season with numerous C2 wins and even a C1 win I came into yesterday wanting more, wanting to win and knowing that I was in a position to do that. Yesterday was an insane race. Viewing the result from an overall season perspective, I am stoked. Three races to go this year, the racing is not over yet"
