Introducing the new Heckler MX
Even more to heckle
•
The new mixed wheel Heckler gives the confidence of a 29-inch wheel up front and retains the snappy handling of a 27.5 wheel out back while the full carbon frame, 140mm-travel fork and lower-link VPP rear suspension design makes the bike sit up and sprint.
•
Pair this with the new Shimano EP8 motor that is lighter, more powerful, and more efficient, and we’ve got an ebike that is even more capable of tackling longer, tougher rides.
•
The Heckler’s not about taking things easy, it’s about making things possible.
