Not sure we have ever seen a more well equipped & loaded-up ride than @trawlence's #Highball29 here packed up and ready to traverse 3000km from the northern tip of New Zealand's North Island, to the Bluff at the Southern tip of the South Island for the #touraotearoa2018
More pics and interview with Tristan from @svenmartinphoto at the @theradavist link in our profile.
