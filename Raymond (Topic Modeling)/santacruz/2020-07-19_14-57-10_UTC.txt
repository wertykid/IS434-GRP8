The first time I shot Fort William was also the last time I raced there. It was the 2007 World Champs and I was racing for South Africa.
Managing & riding for a team with a tight budget meant I had to have side jobs to fund the dream. I was just starting to shoot for a few mags, but since I was also racing I had no real clients. Somehow I managed to hustle shooting Worlds for Decline Magazine. I sold my concept to editor Scott Hart, that the whole feature should only focus on the action & emotions from in & around the finish area on race day.
I never told him that the real reason was because I had to be on my bike, practicing & racing during the rest of the week.
I did my run, then quickly grabbed my gear, and proceeded to shoot the fast guys who came down last. Job done!

Twelve years on, and it’s still largely the finish area photos that matter most at Ft William. From the roar of the crowd when the racers launch into view through the VISIT SCOTLAND arch until they cross the finish line, the amount of iconic shots on offer for a quick thinking, quicker moving photographer is unrivaled by any other World Cup stop. Racing photography is all about telling the day's story, complimenting the venues vibe and capturing the nail biting action. And you never know who is going to win until the final rider crosses the line. With a 3 rider team I try to mix it up to offer some variety, but moving anywhere in the finish arena that’s packed with rowdy fans and only 3+ minutes between riders.
The best, and most fitting way to to describe it would be choreographed chaos. It can be a gamble, but I’ve learned to trust my gut instinct. And if all else fails, and you end up stuck in no-mans-land, I pray and trust that my pre-set remote cameras will save the day.

I have to admit that after that busy day in 2007 I left Scotland more excited with my photos than by my race results, and without realizing it at the time, it was to be my final big UCI DH race behind the bars. From 2008 onwards I became a full-time photographer. One who is lucky enough to still get that race day fix of endorphins pumping through my veins.
