THE SYNDICATE
World Champs Saturday Practice in Leogang.
â€¢
Last practice before race day. Track was drying out, but with cold temps and whole lot of rain predicted overnight and all day Sunday, it's going to be a wild one.
If they have to cancel racing on Sunday (Unlikely but possible) the Quali results will stand as the finals.
Letâ€™s hope we have some good racing conditionsðŸ¤ž
