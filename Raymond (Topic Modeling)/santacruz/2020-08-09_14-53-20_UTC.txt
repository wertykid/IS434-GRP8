Fly On The Wall
•
Many of my “normal” friends often ask me how much longer am I going to keep doing this; Leaving home, living out of a bag for seven months each year just to photograph other people racing bikes. On the surface that is a pretty valid question, my response mirrors the cliched Confucius quote, “Choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.”
Confucius obviously never had to try to find working internet in Scotland at 3am, never spilled a beer onto his MacBook at midnight & never had to fly around the world with his whole life in two overweight bags, but he was definitely on to something. I’ve been shooting World Cup racing for just over thirteen years now but luckily as a photographer every day offers something new, even at some of the tired old repeat venues. I’m out in nature with fresh mountain air & get to witness & document some of the greatest feats of human coordination, skill, determination & bravery. No two days are alike, no outcomes are predetermined, be it in the weather, light or action. I get to see some amazing things and do my best to document it justly for posterity's sake.

There are stories to be told everywhere, sometimes I manufacture and plan shots, like a sneaky pole cam shot intruding on Steve getting rid of his nerves in a bathroom stall moments before his race run up top near the start of Ft William. Other times, moments just present themselves in front of you, like a fox crossing my path while I quietly lie waiting for a shot, or a snake slithering by while I’m in deep in the bush setting up for a sneaky secret sniper shot. Moments in nature that make you forget you are just at another bike race. Never mind the poor spider covered in neon course marking spray inching its way down the roots that I’m zoomed in on waiting for a tyre to appear. Old rediscovered shots allow you to relive forgotten moments, bring smiles and spark emotions.
Details, stories, angles & emotions, it doesn’t matter if it’s a maiden WC win celebration or some bandy legged goon riding, it’s these fly on the wall moments that keep me coming back each and every year.
