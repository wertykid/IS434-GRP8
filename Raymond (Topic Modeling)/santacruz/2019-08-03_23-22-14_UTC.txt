What a day in Val di Sole!
THE SYNDICATE had some amazing ups & downs on what has to be the gnarliest track of the season, with @lorisvergier taking 3rd, @gregminnaar in 7th WITH a crash (oh what could have been...) and @luca_shaw in 19th after a qualifying day that saw him sitting in the dirt/mud as often as he was on 2 wheels.

Bonus, @scsyndicate takes Top Team on the weekend⚡️⚡️⚡️
•
Huge shout-out to @tuhotoariki for taking the Junior Men win aboard his #V10CC!
•
Next stop Lenzerheide🇨🇭before heading to World Champs.
