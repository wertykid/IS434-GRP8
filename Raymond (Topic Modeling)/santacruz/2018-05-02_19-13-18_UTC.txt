Our pal Mike, aka @nekrider of Vermont Santa Cruz dealer @eastburkesports is fired up about his new #Nomad4 build.
"first time on the Nomad and we climbed Highland 5 times...it climbs as well as the Bronson 1 did, descends even better than the Nomad 3...I may, in fact, sell my DH bike..." Look for Mike and his Nomad around the @kingdomtrails and at @highland_mtn this season👍⚡️
