Luke Cryer defines style at speed. He came from the world of gate starts and elbows, even winning silver & bronze medals at the 2015/2016 4X World Championships. Now it’s the thrill of pitching himself against himself that holds most worth.

In 2020 Luke was looking for a new bike and hit up Josh @loosedoglewis seeing if he had any leads on something brand new or second-hand.
Loose Dog lives the mantra of “pay it forward” and has been passing along his old bikes to friends and helping talented friends get setup with bikes through his sponsors for a while. Loose managed to get his hands on a bike wasn’t being used and it became Luke’s new ride.
And this is what he does with it.

It’s good to get something new, but if a bike is built to last then there’s no reason it can’t have many lives. Santa Cruz builds quality bikes that can take a beating and kept running for many lifetimes. Pay it forward.
