World Cup qualifying is finishing up in Maribor right now, but the @scsyndicate crew will be a man down after @luca_shaw’s ‘sore shoulder’ from a big crash during testing last week in San Romolo turned out to be a broken collarbone👎

We are gutted for him, but the good news is that due to Luca’s elite physical conditioning and #WaffleHouse nutrition program, the fracture should be healed in time for World Cup Rd 2 in Fort William👍
