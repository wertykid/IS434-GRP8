The 2022 Santa Cruz Heckler 29 & MX Ebike Review @TheLoamWolf
•
“Our time aboard the bike has been plentiful but not nearly enough for our standards of what is required in a long-term review, so stay tuned for that. What we did learn so far however, is that Santa Cruz’s new Heckler is a lot more capable all around. The range is greatly increased while rollover speed and confidence are better thanks to the larger wheel and updated geometry. What carries over and may even be improved as well is the bike’s ability to jump, dance, hop and snap with an almost effortless feel.”
