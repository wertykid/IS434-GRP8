It’s a short but busy week here at the Santa Cruz factory while we all get ready to take a quick break for the Thanksgiving holiday.
It’s been a weird couple years, and the SCB crew is itching to get out for some riding and relaxing. Like Eric shown here, who was recently profiled in our Chameleon: Five Riders Rides feature on our website.
If you missed it, it’s definitely worth checking out. Link in bio🔝
