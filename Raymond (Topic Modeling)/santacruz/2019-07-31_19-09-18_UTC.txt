Friends in the Calgary area, please keep an eye out for this heavily modified/adaptive V10 owned by @good_n_you and STOLEN off the back of his van in Calgary AB on Monday.

All stolen bikes are important to their owners, but this one is just a bit more important due to its uniqueness and the freedom it provides to Ryan.
