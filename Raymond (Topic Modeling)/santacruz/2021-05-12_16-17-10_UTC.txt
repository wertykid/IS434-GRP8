*PayDirt is our commitment to increasing access to trails by supporting the work of people who make it happen. We’re pledging to donate $1 million over the next three years towards trail projects, local organizations, events and programs that are geared towards creating and strengthening opportunities for people to get out on the trails.
If you are part of a Trail Building or Trail Advocacy group that needs help with funding, be sure to check out our 2022 PayDirt application page when it goes live again in January 👊
