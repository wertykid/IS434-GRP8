Today was supposed to be the start of what has come to feel like our hometown event - The @seaotterclassic. 
The venue is less than an hour down the California coast, but right now feels a million miles away...So we are throwing it back to last year, where @mitchropo won the best event of the weekend - Dual Slalom - for the 3rd straight year, @walkershaw won the DH on a 135mm travel Hightower, @danny_macaskill was winning over the crowds, and the @scsyndicate was warming up for the 2019 World Cup race season.

Really hope to see you all back in Monterey in OctoberðŸ–¤
