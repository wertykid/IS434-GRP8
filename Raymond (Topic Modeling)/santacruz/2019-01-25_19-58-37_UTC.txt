We have a Stewardship page on our website. It doesn’t get a ton of traffic compared to the rest of the site, and hey, we get it. There are a lot of beautiful bikes to look at.
But we also know that without trail builders & trail advocacy efforts we wouldn’t have anywhere to use those beautiful bikes, so we spend a lot of our time, energy and our money to help those efforts. 
Santa Cruz Bicycles employees get paid days off to go work on trails, both local, and on travel trips. Often times they do it for free. Sometimes they do it for beer. 
In 2018 alone we had 1,411 employee hours volunteered for advocacy, and donated $400,155 to support new trails and for trail maintenance on existing trails.
Most importantly we work with and support many amazing North American trail advocacy organizations including Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship, Mountain Bikers of Santa Cruz (MBoSC), Land Trust of Santa Cruz County (LTSC), Sustainable Trails Coalition (STC), International Mountain Bike Association (IMBA), Trans-Cascadia, Central Oregon Trail Alliance (COTA), Northwest Trail Alliance (NWTA), and more. 
And over the last couple years we have been expanding our reach to international trail advocacy efforts world-wide. 
We can post pretty bike pictures all day long, in fact we love posting those pics, but without the help of all the people and organizations mentioned above there would be a lot less awesome trails out there for all of us to ride on. 
How can you help? Search online or ask your local bike shop if there are local trail building groups you can assist. Get involved and do what you can. Every little bit helps.
And hug your local trail builder today❤️
