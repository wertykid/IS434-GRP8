When it comes to World Cup event hospitality, no one does it better than the Santa Cruz Bicycles Switzerland crew @trailworkstraildesign.
Display bikes, bar, bands, and a sweet view of the race.
Trailworks was also the driving force behind building the Lenzerheide DH course with a a little help from some guy named @stevepeat.
Big cheers to Rudy/Rafael and all who helped make it happen!
