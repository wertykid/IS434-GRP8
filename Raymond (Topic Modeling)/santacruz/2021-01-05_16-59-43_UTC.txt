Santa Cruz PayDirt Fund Profile - Ridgeline’s Garfagnana Bike Project
•
Rich & Sandra are joint founders and owners of Ridgeline, which is a mountain bike holiday company operating and based out in the Northern Tuscany region in a place called the Garfagnana. (Pronounced: Gar-fan-yaa-na!).
•
They set up Ridgeline back in 2015 as an escape from the corporate rat race in England and Germany and had the shared dream of having the adventure of setting up a totally new MTB destination from scratch in an relatively unknown part of the world.
•
Sandra and Rich spent years pouring over maps to find our untouched white spot with the perfect mountains and where no one else was operating. And six years later here they are with about 250km of trail network created, including 98km of hand-built tracks, an incredible team, and amazing guests that return year-after-year.
