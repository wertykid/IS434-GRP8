| Stoked On MS Bronson CC - The Details in the Design |
•
When we asked Andy McKenna for inspiration for the design of the @stokedonms benefit bike he said that it had to stand out, look unlike any Santa Cruz Bronson anyone could currently buy, but also look so cool that the raffle winner would still want to ride it.
The topographic design nearly hidden in the orange parts of the paint aren't just generic squiggles but was taken from the old Ordinance Survey maps of the Torridon region in the Scottish Highlands, a place Andy regards above nearly anywhere on earth. 
Part of the reason for Andy's love of the area is that he's spent so much time with his wife, @mrsgowherescotland, staying in bothies, sleeping in bivys  and exploring deep into the area's trails.
