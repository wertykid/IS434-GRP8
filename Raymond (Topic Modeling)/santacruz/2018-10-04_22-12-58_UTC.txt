As everyone crawls out of the woods and back to civilization, photographic evidence of what has been hailed as the “best bike race, best trails, & best time ever” has started to flow in from the #transcascadia2018 
We have so many good images to share, but we’ll start at the end with an impressive ALL @santacruzbicycles podium with @lorisvergier taking the win (#BronsonCC), @francoismtb39 in 2nd (#HightowerLTC) & @luca_shaw in 3rd (#BronsonCC). Well done crew!⚡️⚡️⚡️
Much more to come, and you can also find a @transcascadia photo recap news post link in our profile👍
