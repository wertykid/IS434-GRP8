#THESYNDICATE - Episode.2 - Loris

This time around we follow one of the newest recruits around his home in Cagne-sur-Mer. 
Loris gives us the lowdown on racing in denim, Ferrari-esque cars, and the fast-life of twisting throttles near white sandy beaches, and then it's on to Ft. William and Leogang for World Cup action with the whole team.
