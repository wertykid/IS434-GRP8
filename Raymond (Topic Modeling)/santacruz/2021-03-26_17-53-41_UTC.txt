Santa Cruz Bullit - Best In Class - 2021 @theloamwolf eBike shootout💥
•
“The Best in Class winner is the bike that has the absolute best performance up and down the trail, that our riders want to keep for themselves...when our testers focused on which Enduro eBike  they wanted to take home with them, most of us agreed that the Santa Cruz Bullit was the one. It absolutely shreds downhills, is fun to ride, inspires you to push hard, up and down hill, and has a feel that eliminates that “I’m on an eBike” feeling”
