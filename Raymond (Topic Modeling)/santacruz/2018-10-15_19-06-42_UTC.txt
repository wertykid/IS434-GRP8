Huge congratulations goes out to our own @kiran.mackinnon who was recently crowned the 2018 #ProGRT National Series champion!
Here at the Santa Cruz Bicycles Factory Kiran works as an Engineering Tech and Product Development Tester but when he’s not dialing in product he’s out chasing podiums. The series this year started in Windrock, TN and wrapped up in Mammoth, CA.
Kiran also mixed a few UCI World Cup DH races in there👍
