Santa Cruz #htSQD - Breck Epic Day 1 
•
Less than 24hrs after winning the punishing Leadville 100 MTB race, Keegan Swenson saddled back up and went out to take the lead on the first day of the 2021 @breckepic stage race with teammate Alexis Skarda also taking the women’s lead 🤯🤯 and Tobin Ortenblad not far behind👌
This crew is unreal 🙌
