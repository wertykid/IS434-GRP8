Bike Check!
@danny_macaskill’s custom Santa Cruz carbon trials bike🛸
•
Built in our Santa Cruz, California carbon test lab, Danny’s bike is an experiment in what can can be done when your lofty goal is to make the perfect bike for a single rider that uses his bike in ways no one else really does.
Now that I’ve typed it out, that sounds like a slightly crazy way to spend our limited time and resources, but the truth is, what we learn along the way helps us make all of our bikes better🤘
