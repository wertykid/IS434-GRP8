@Luca_Shaw comes down the mountain in 8th at the Val di Sole World Cup and finishes the season in 13th overall.
While a few mishaps at a couple races kept Luca out of the top ten overall on the season, his consistent top results - Qualified 5 times in the top 10 & Finished 3 times in the top 10 - show that he's a 21 year old force to be reckoned with.
Looking forward to seeing what Luca can do in Cairns at the UCI World Champs next week!
