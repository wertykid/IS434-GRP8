@iagogaray is pretty excited about the custom paint job on his new #HightowerCC, all built up for the 2017 Enduro race season. 
He dialed it in for the @NZEnduro, then got some good trail time in during the @jamienicolladventures New Zealand Roadtrip (@50to01 video link in our profile) and is now in Rotorura along with the rest of the Santa Cruz/@SRAMMTB enduro team for the start of the @world_enduro this weekend. Have a good one out there boys!
