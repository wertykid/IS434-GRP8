Young blood, but old hands. Loris & Luca have followed similar trajectories and near parallel career paths during their early years of World Cup racing. In 2014, both juniors, they are neck on neck, trading wins, two a piece and it’s a battle right to the end of the season, finishing 1st & 2nd respectively. Grabbing top tens finishes (a podium for Loris) as rookie Elites they both further cement themselves into the top ten with podiums in their 2nd year.

Both have loving and supporting families with cycling in their veins, Claude Vergier battles Bruni senior at Masters Worlds mirroring the ongoing battle between their respective offspring in the majors, While Doug Shaw goes about nabbing all the major Cols in Europe as Luca tackles the rough downhills tracks.

In 2017 they are both conscripted into the Syndicate. Collectively they bring down the average age of the team significantly. The move is genius not only is the future bright for the Syndicate but the challenge of youth re-ignites a fire within Minnaar and he goes on a stormer proving there’s still plenty of bite left in the top dog. With big shoes to fill and no doubt some weighty expectations on their shoulders they waste no time in turning heads. All eyes are on them at the season opener, new year, new team, new bike and new BIG wheel size. Luca and Loris go one and three in qualifying, they have arrived!
-
A couple of years of highs and lows for both of them, a slew of wins in qualifying and some frustrating crashes. Bad luck with niggling injuries they still push relentlessly, already podium proven they are now both after the win. It comes first for Loris, bittersweet watching from the hot seat as teammate, number one qualifier and last man down, Luca crashes out in Andorra. Loris is buoyed on by another duo of French Revolutionaries and more podiums soon follow. Luca grabs a couple but will no doubt be wanting to balance the scales more evenly once again and bring his version of the Red White and Blue onto the top step. I can’t wait to see how their intertwined story continues to develop when we head out healthy and ready to race again.
