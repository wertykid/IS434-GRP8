Digging @transcascadia ⛏

A whole lot of hard work goes into building a 4 day point-to-point enduro course, so a couple of weeks ago we loaded up the trucks with supplies we’d need for a few days of remote trail work in preparation for #TransCascadia2018
A big benefit here is after the race is over, the new-built and re-built trails remain for all to enjoy, so it's a race that gives back in a big way to the riding community of the Pacific Northwest.
Check out the News section of our website for more words and photos to see why we feel @transcascadia is a special event.
