The Chameleon has evolved.
As the name implies, the Chameleon is a Swiss army knife of bikes, capable of shifting from hardtail ripper to bikepacking mule and everything in between. 
Now adaptable from 29er to 27.5-plus, geared or singlespeed, the Chameleon utilizes a series of swappable dropouts to change modes.
With a low stance and laid-back geometry, the #Chameleon delivers that stable feel that defines the modern trail bike.
