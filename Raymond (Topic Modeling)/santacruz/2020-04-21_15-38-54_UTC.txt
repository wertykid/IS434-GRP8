Big shout-out to our Warranty Manager -Willie Bullian- celebrating his 20th Anniversary here at @santacruzbicycles🙌

If in the last 20 years you have contacted us with a warranty issue, or maybe needed some fresh bearings or other random part, odds are you have talked to him.
Or you could have stopped by the @seaotterclassic booth with a bent derailleur hanger and received a fresh one out of his back pocket.
Or just maybe you got passed on a climb by a scruffy looking guy with the sleeves torn off his jersey riding a stickered up singlespeed, that’s Willie.

Santa Cruz is proud to be part of the Willie K. Bullian Experience™️
Cheers Willie🍻

*FunFact: Willie’s dog Driver8 (RIP), as seen in the last slide here, was the name inspiration for our 2009 bike model Driver8🖤
