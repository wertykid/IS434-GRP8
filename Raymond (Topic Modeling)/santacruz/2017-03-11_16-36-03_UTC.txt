A very wet Day 2 of the @nzenduro made the already technical trails of the Nydia Bay sections even more treacherous, but apparently the extreme weather helped Scotsman @MarkScott259 feel right at home, winning three of the four stages and a second in the other. A great day of racing bumped Mark up to second overall with one day to go! ðŸ“· @garyperkin #hightowercc
