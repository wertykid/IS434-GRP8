Five Riders Rides #1 - The Barmeleon by Sven Busse
•
Sven wanted to build a bike that was always ready for any type of shenanigans.
Meeting friends at his bar, The @gegenueber_bar in the middle of Bielefeld, right next to a large skatepark? Take the bike.
Need to go to the music studio in the morning. Grab the bike! 
Lunchbreak in the skatepark? Ride the bike!
Scout in the woods? Shred the bike!
