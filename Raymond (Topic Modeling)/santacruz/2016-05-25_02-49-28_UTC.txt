Our man on the scene in Canada @sebkemp wanted to show his appreciation for some of the local BC trail builders, Ian Kruger @porca2016, of the Pemberton Valley Trails & Tim Haggerty, one of the most prolific builders in Whistler, so he picked up some new trail building tools from #RogueHoe, branded them up, and presented them to the guys. Thanks for making the biking world a better place Tim & Ian! #gettingshitdone
