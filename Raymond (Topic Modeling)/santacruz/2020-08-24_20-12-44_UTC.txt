While Santa Cruz, California life is still a struggle with the local wildfires making permanent changes to our lives and landscape, 6,000 miles away our favorite Frenchie @lorisvergier headed to the mountain town of Les MÃ©nuires, for the French National DH ChampionshipsðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
â€¢
Anyone paying attention knows that French DH racers are dominating the field these days, so competition was expected to be fierce with 3 of the top 5 riders - Including Loris - from the 2019 World Cup in attendance.
â€¢
Loris Qualified 1st and came down last in the finals.
In the end the top 3 were super tightly grouped and Loris was just +0.86 back from the win and only +0.14 off of 2nd, taking 3rd overallðŸ¥‰
â€¢
Another race, another podium. Congratulations Loris & @scsyndicateðŸ™Œ
