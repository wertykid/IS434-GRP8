| 2019 @TransProvence Day Two | 
Race organizer, Ash Smith, is fond of the saying, “it’s a game of two halves” - and today was one such game at Trans-Provence. The day started off sunny and warm in Colmars, but there was the threat of afternoon thunderstorms looming large in the mountains surrounding our destination in Valberg.
