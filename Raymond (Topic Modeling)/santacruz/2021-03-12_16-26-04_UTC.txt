//FKT-WRT//
Fastest Known Time on the White Rim Trail
•
The newly assembled Santa Cruz htSQD loaded their bikes in the van and headed to Moab to attempt to grab the fastest known time on the White Rim Trail, 100 miles of dusty, wind-battered off-road trail in Canyonlands National Park.
Aboard for the ride were Keegan Swenson, Alexis Skarda & Tobin Ortenblad - A team of individuals with an XC addiction.
•
Keegan and Alexis have been down this road before, as they are both former FKT/WRT record holders before having their respective times bested in 2020.
Tobin decided to make an attempt at the FKT for the clockwise direction, which is the opposite of the traditional route. 
•
7 hrs later ALL were successful:
Keegan's time - 5:28:17 *New FKT - Just 6 seconds faster than the previous record.
Alexis' time - 6:52:55 *New Women’s FKT - 4 minutes and 5 seconds faster than the previous record. 
Tobin's time - 6:16:38 - *New FKT for the clockwise direction.
Amazing work crew🙌
