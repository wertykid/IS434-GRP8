While we are sadly not in Portugal this weekend for the start of the World Cup season, weâ€™ll throw back to 2008 when @stevepeat won the Lisbon Urban DH for the 7th straight time, with @scsyndicate teammate @gregminnaar close behind in 2nd.
Peaty would also go on to win the Lisbon DH the following year making it 8 in a row.
