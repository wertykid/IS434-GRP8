Jonas Johnson/@jcycletech is our product tech contact at @chriskingbuzz for the Santa Cruz Syndicate and has helped us out with countless projects that all needed to be done at a moments notice, so when Jonas asked for a little help getting his personal bike customized, we were happy to oblige. He knew he wanted the Bronson Kalimotxo frame but also had some inspiration in the form of a very colorful SDG Circuit Mtn Shibuya saddle and here is the result. Some may say too colorful, but i'll be damned if he didn't somehow pull it all off.
