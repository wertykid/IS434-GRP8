3 days in the @BreckEpic is living up to its name. 
The backcountry stage race in the Colorado Rocky Mountains covers some amazing terrain with brutal climbs, snow covered passes and a base elevation of almost 10,000 feet. 
There is also miles of sweet singletrack.
The week started out with freezing rain, then moved into cloudy skies, then all blue by day 3. With almost 20,000 vertical feet of climbs so far, itâ€™s a crusher....and thereâ€™s still 3 days to go!
