THE SYNDICATE 
Worlds Qualifying🌧
⚡️
@lorisvergier had the 2nd quickest qualifying time on the day with a wicked-fast run in the slick conditions🤘
⚡️
@luca_shaw with an unfortunate mechanical at the start, got it sorted fairly quick and had a good run the rest of the way finishing 30th.
⚡️
@gregminnaar finished with the 7th fastest qualifying time, but had a slight mishap on a wet and slippery corner, clipping some poles and running just outside the tape, earning a DQ. Still a protected rider so no damage done.
⚡️
Everyone hoping for a (relatively) dry finals on Sunday!🤞
