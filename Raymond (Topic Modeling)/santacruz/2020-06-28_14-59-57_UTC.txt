If it wasn’t for Dirt Magazine I wouldn’t be where I am now. Simple as that. Before Dirt entered my life, I was a full time skateboarder and undercover mountain biker. MTB was my dirty secret that I hid from my skateboarding brethren, it just wasn’t cool. Then in the early 2000’s I happened across a copy of Dirt Magazine, an eye opening revelation in stark contrast to the existing mainstream. A whole new subculture & lifestyle celebrating individuality, performance & style. Cutting edge photography paired with frenetic design & clean layouts of creative chaos. Bikes were passports to pleasure, from dreamy alpine road trips to dark wet pub ride frenzies but it was the rarefied & glorified world of downhill racing that was celebrated most & held in highest regard. I was hooked. It’s hard to convey just how much influence, pull & power Dirt had, gracing its pages was an honour & covers were lusted & fought over if you were a rider or photographer.

Come end of year it was an almost sure bet the it would go to the most deserving or break out rider that year. In 2008 that man of the moment was Greg Minnaar. With the World Cup Series wrapped up only four days prior in a wet Schladming, we now found ourselves in polar opposite conditions under the scorching sun of Las Vegas trying to deliver an eye catching cover commissioned by the ever particular Dirt editor/visionary Mike Rose. AKA god.

Greg, still jet lagged & hung over from trans-Atlantic celebrations, arrived with no riding kit other than helmet & goggles & his bike still had spikes on, an incongruent anomaly here in the desert. Combined with the ever present Inter-bike distractions, I had my work cut out.

Luckily I had the “end of year Dirt cover shot” cheat sheet up my sleeve. I knew Mike was a sucker for the “blue sky, dry dirt shot” since this issue would hit the shelves during the dark gloomy days of the British winter & I already knew of a zone where I had shot Steve Peat  carving a turn two years earlier that made the cover. After a couple of turns and only two jumps I knew we had captured something special & perfect for a cover.
