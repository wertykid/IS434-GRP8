We are pleased to announce the 2020 PayDirt Grant Recipients!
•
A year ago Santa Cruz pledged $1 million dollars to fund recreational mountain bike trail opportunities around the world, and today we’re announcing 17 organizations as the first to receive PayDirt grants🤝
•
PayDirt recipients span three continents and encompass a wide variety of groups from land trusts to national advocacy organizations to high school race teams and grassroots trail builders.  And while PayDirt might be a new concept, we haven't forgotten our roots: we continue to support our long-standing partners while adding several more organizations both at home in North America and internationally.
