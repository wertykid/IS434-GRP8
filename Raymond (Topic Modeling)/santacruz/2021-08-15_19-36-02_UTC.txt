What a race today in Maribor!
Not a lot of lead change until the top 10 came down, but from then on it was fast and furious.
In the end Greg was taking another walk to the podium in 4th place and Luca was just off it in 7th ⚡️
Nice job crew 🙌
Now we’re going to carry this momentum into Val di Sole 🇮🇹 for World Champs!
