The inspiration for our involvement in this cause is a deeply personal one that started from a professional relationship with our good friends and partners - Andy and Aneela McKenna of @gowherescotlandmtb, a mountain bike guiding business in Scotland.
After years of inspiring us with epic MTB tours of the great Scottish north, Andy now inspires us in his battle against what is currently still an incurable disease, Multiple Sclerosis.
If you’re already convinced you want this Bronson then click the link and go buy your raffle tickets...but please also click through to read why this is about more than a sweet bike, and hear Andy's story in his own words. We guarantee it will put a little heart, and mind, into your Valentines Day❤️
