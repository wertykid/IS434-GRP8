Santa Cruz Bicycles Employees Affected by CZU Fire - FUNDRAISER
•
As many of you know the mountains around Santa Cruz are currently in the midst of a historic fire event.
At this time there are 44 Santa Cruz Bicycles employees that have been evacuated and displaced, and 4 are already confirmed to have lost their homes entirely. Many more are waiting to hear about when they will be able to return to their homes, and if they even have a home left to return to.
•
While Santa Cruz company support is directly helping displaced employees with immediate needs as well as helping plan longer term financial care, a great many of our friends and industry partners have reached out to ask how they can help. We are humbled by your thoughts and generosity. 
The Santa Cruz Bicycles community thanks you for your support🖤
