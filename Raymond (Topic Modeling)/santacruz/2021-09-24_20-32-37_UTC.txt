The 2021 @transcascadia is on!
Oh yes, there is epic racing on some of the sweetest trails in the Pacific Northwest, but what you may not realize is that a big part of what the TC is all about is the reclaiming, building, and maintaining of these trails by the TC crew and their industry partners so that there are trails to race on, then continue to exist for everyone to enjoy✌️
Cheers @transcascadia🍻
