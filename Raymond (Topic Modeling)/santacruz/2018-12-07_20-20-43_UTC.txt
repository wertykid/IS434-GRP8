Feel good story of our year...after winning #FiveBucksaFoot, our annual Sierra Buttes Trail Stewardship fundraiser for @sierratrails, Michael Knighten of San Francisco was rewarded with his choice of any @santacruzbicycles MTB worth up to $10,000.
BUT instead of claiming the prize for himself,  Michael chose to generously donate five brand new Santa Cruz Chameleons worth $2,000 each to five kids in Plumas County, giving birth to a new program called Knights of the Lost Sierra.
Managed by Mandy Beatty, the STBS Trails Program Coordinator, #KnightsOfTheLostSierra was an open application to any Plumas County youth interested in volunteering 10 separate 5-hour days at SBTS events and trail days, working 50 total hours to ownership of a new mountain bike. 
Over the last year, five youths put in the time and effort, each earning themselves a brand new mountain bike thanks to Michael’s generosity.
“My favorite thing about this program is the long-term commitment the participants made to service and their public lands” said Mandy Beatty. “We started digging on trail days in the snow, sweated it out on Mt Hough and Cascade Trail, and were chasing daylight and cold in the Basin. 
Participants saw and experienced their public lands through all the seasons and it wasn’t an instant gratification process.”💪
