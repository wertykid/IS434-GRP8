| Sundays With Sven 
Outside the tape. 
•
While the list of Syndicate titles, championships & accolades is a long one, what makes them so successful is that they know how to find a balance both during & after the race season. Mental & physical stresses can easily take their toll during the yearly cycle & they know a bow that is too tightly strung is all too easily broken, so distractions are both sought & needed.
With their reputation you wouldn’t be far off the mark in assuming that this would manifest itself in a couple of rounds of beers, or bottles of wine. That goes without saying, but they are, thankfully, more multidimensional than that.

From the beginning Steve has always been the peoples champ, and that didn’t change when he finally became the World Champ. Alongside various business endeavours he’s always made a point of spreading the joys of riding world wide and is only too happy to give back to his local community as well.

Greg is a gifted and multi-talented sportsman. Golf, moto, surfing and cliff diving, he does it all.  He’s also the first to open the wine after track walk day.
•
Josh loves to ride and loves to get naked,. Sometimes both at the same time. Any bike, any place, any time. He didn’t need a sculpted or manicured bike park, just some good beats and irie vibes.

Loris leads a mysterious double life, he’s managed to stealthily train for his secret passion of enduro despite being feverishly courted by the French fashion houses. Eschewing their inevitable grasp for one more season.
•
Despite his youth, Luca’s Zen wisdom runs deep, he’s always marched to his own beat. When he’s outside the tape on Sundays there's a good chance you can find him watching and supporting his better-half inside the tape, needless to say he spends more time on his XC bike these days even though he doesn’t ride it like one.

But it was Kirt Voreis, one of the Syndicate original members who first figured out the importance of balance and life beyond the tape. Pioneering new professional paths simply by following his passions. We love you Kirt, don’t ever change.
