Playing the part of pied piper for the @scsyndicate, @stevepeat was the main instigator for getting the full #santacruzsyndicate crew out to the #transcascadia2018 this year.
He signed up early, then quickly convinced @gregminnaar, @luca_shaw & @lorisvergier to get in on the action🤘
Stories from @loosedoglewis about the 2017 @transcascadia stoked the fire.
Cheers Peaty🍻
