True Story: Ben Hildred - @srammtb
•
Great profile by the SRAM crew on @BenHildred who dedicated December 2019 to burning the candle at both ends, waking each day at 5 a.m. to grind out a minimum average of 1,834 vertical metres of ascending before heading to work at 7:45 a.m. — after 30 days he had reached his goal of 55,000 meters — the equivalent elevation of the earth’s stratosphere.
