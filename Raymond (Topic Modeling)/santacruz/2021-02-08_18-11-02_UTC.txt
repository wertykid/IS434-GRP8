The Beta Tests: Santa Cruz Nomad X01 CC
•
New Nomad review from the new @BetaMTB crew:
“The Santa Cruz Nomad is its own animal, never really feeling like its goal is to go head-to-head with the more race-ready rigs in the test, but rather do the opposite. It offers a distinctly different ride quality, aiming at creativity over speed and encouraging pop over planted-ness. It got one tester rethinking the one-bike quiver that modern design and technology have finally made possible. The new Nomad offers so much pure fun that it doesn’t feel like it would be redundant in any garage. Just different in the best kind of way...”
