The New Chameleon
â€¢
Five Riders Rides #4 - Mike Hillâ€™s Tool Carrying Mule
â€¢
Mike Hill is a UK-based builder of custom BMX frames, Deathpack BMX. He's spent a lifetime riding dirt jumps on a BMX but wanted to build an off-road workhorse to carry tools down the singletrack to the woods where his trails are.
The Chameleon is a tool as much as the shovels and spades he carries upon it.
