Today this guy goes into the Mountain Bike Hall Of Fame.
We would list all his all his accomplishments here, but that would take way too long.
Peaty is a true legend in the history of DH racing, and as an ambassador to the sport. 
We are proud to have Steve as part of Santa Cruz family for life. 
Congratulations @stevepeat!
Youâ€™ve earned it ðŸ‘Š
