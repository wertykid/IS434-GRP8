- Dirt Magic -
Downiville is somewhat of a second home to us here at Santa Cruz.
It’s where a bunch of our friends are, where we go to help build trails, where a lot of our bike testing happens, where we have our company/employee weekend party, where we sponsor the @downievilleclassic_ and the home base of our partners at @sierratrails

#DirtMagic is a new 
film about Downieville’s journey from dying mining town to mountain bike mecca is out now and available to watch at the Patagonia YouTube channel.
