The aluminum Chameleon is our least expensive model, but it’s also one of our favorites
•
It’s a cost effective and extremely versatile ride, be it geared or single-speed, 29” or 27.5+ (with up to 27.5x3.0 tire compatibility)
•
Great for XC, but even better for more aggressive Trail use with a 67.3 HT angle with a 120mm fork used on 29” wheels & 130mm fork on 27.5+
•
Also a fantastic bike packing option if that’s your thing🏕
