Old Enough To Know Better | Rab Wardell | Ep.4 - Final Episode
•
This is it. Starting back with his West Highland Way FKT, @rabwardell has now been on an 18 month journey. What started as an idea, and went through various iterations of a fragile reality, has now become a very lucid reality.
Rab will take to the start the line in Plymouth, on a course steeped in UK cycling folklore, against the best the nation has to offer. As the pressure mounts, it’s important to remember that this a choice, and no matter the outcome, Rab is slowly proving to himself, and others, that dreams, in all their unfiltered chaos, are there to be chased.
