It’s Ride Your Bike day again here at Santa Cruz. 
Everyone at the company gets a paid day off to go ride their bike wherever and however they like. 🙏
Usually this also involves big group rides in epic locals, but this year (as with all things 2020) it’s a little more of the #GoSolo vibe. Still a great day to get out in the dirt...
Have a good one out there employeees of Santa Cruz Bicycles🙌
