Bike Check - Greg Minnaar’s WINNING ride from the Lousã World Cup weekend🏆
•
Quick look at Greg’s V10 Setup - Most noticeable is the red swingarm he stole... I mean ‘borrowed’ from @luca_shaw’s V1029er (Luca rode his #V10MX) to replace the custom extended swingarm Greg has been running for a while. The idea being that the shorter rear end is a bit quicker to accelerate and pump thorough tight sections to maintain speed. Looks like it worked👌
