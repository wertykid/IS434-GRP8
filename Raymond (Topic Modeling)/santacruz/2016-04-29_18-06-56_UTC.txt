#Tallboy3 first look reviews are starting to roll in !

@bicyclingmag - "The Tallboy is an efficient bike: It feels quick and crisp; and the suspension is very quiet when climbing and accelerating, with little noticeable motion. Santa Cruz’s VPP system has always been efficient, but the latest iteration on this TB3 feels like the engineers have found a way to make the suspension even more efficient, but without noticeably sacrificing sensitivity. The bike feels fast, but stays connected when pedaling through rough bits, or up and over roots. Here’s that refrain I mentioned: The TB3 pedals like a shorter travel, XC-style bike, but has the sensitivity of a bike with more travel.” Check out the full review at the link in our profile. 📷& words by Bicycling test director @ilikesushi
