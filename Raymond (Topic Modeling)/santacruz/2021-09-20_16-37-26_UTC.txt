Great finish to the World Cup season in Snowshoe for the @santacruzfsa crew with @lucabraidot on the XCO podium in 5th 🙌, an ailing @maxime_marotte fighting through it in 10th, @marti_berta98 in 18th and @gretaseiwald in 19th.
Full team in the top 20! 👏👏👏👏
Big thanks to everyone at SC FSA for a hard fought race season👊
