Syndicate 2022! 
All The Pieces Fall Into Place.
• 
Puzzlin’ ain’t easy. 
We’ve taken the most successful pieces and added a whole bunch of fresh ones to create the widest ranging yet most interlocking cast of characters and partners the Santa Cruz Syndicate has ever fielded.
•
The mainstays…
Greg Minnaar (RSA): World Champion. Now entering his 24th season of World Cup racing, and 40th year of his full-throttle One Life attitude to time on this planet. The kingpin of puzzling knows how to put it all together like no one else. That’s why he’s the reigning champ and most prolific male downhill winner we’ll likely ever see.

Steve Peat (GBR): Head Coach and athlete. Steve’s deep knowledge of World Cup training, After three decades in the business, this Gandalf of Gravity brings a unique advantage and touch of magic to the team. Just don’t call him Old Skool, he’s still damn quick and never shy of a challenge…

And now, NEW for Twenty Two…
•
Laurie Greenland (GBR): on our radar since his junior racing days, the stars over Greenland never quite aligned with those in California until this year. The surfing, skating, bmxing Bristolian is already an accomplished racer and couldn’t be a better fit for the team.

Nina Hoffmann (GER): protégé of the Juliana Bicycles program, it’s hard to imagine “The Hoff” has only been racing for such a short time, but Nina’s trajectory is one of the most inspiring in racing and we’re proud to be part of it.

Jackson Goldstone (CAN): the current Junior World Champion probably still gets jigsaws for his birthday, but Jackson turns 18 this year and is poised to throw a whole box of firecrackers into the Elite ranks in 2023. Until then, Steve and Greg are mentoring the former “Super Grom” through another junior season, in preparation for that leap into primetime.
