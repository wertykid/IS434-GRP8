Danny doesn't stop talking about ebikes. He's infatuated with them.  In fact, the only time he's not chewing someone's ear off about how “mint” they are is when he's riding one. And when he's riding his ebike he just rides and rides and rides. Which is why we've equipped the newest Heckler to venture further and faster, for longer.

150mm of efficient VPP suspension matched to a 720wh battery is a potent combo that makes all-day odysseys feel like a Wee Day Out. The interchangeable battery system also means you need never resort to catching a Highland locomotive home either. Just swap out your battery on the trail and keep rolling.

But with great power comes great responsibility. The Heckler gets Danny so far out that we have a duty to ensure he makes it back too. This bike is built right and built to last.  We sweat the carbon layup, frame details, and build kits to ensure the Heckler withstands being repeatedly ridden “to the bloody moon” (and back), whatever the weather back on earth.

Just take Danny’s word for it. Or you can see for yourself at the link in bio👆
