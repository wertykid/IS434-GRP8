Luke Cryer + Santa Cruz Jackal =🤘
•
This easy-going cut follows Luke and the Jackal as they burn a quick sunset lap at the local dirt jumps.
•
The Jackal is our no BS dirt jump, pump track, and urban assault bike. 
Overbuilt to last forever, yet still weighs in at under 5lbs for the frame. Unique sliding rear dropouts allow for a geared setup as well as single speed.
