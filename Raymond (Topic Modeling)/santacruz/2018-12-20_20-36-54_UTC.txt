Check out this one-of-a-kind custom #NomadCC, signed by the entire Santa Cruz Syndicate that @santacruzbicyclesau/@wearelusty is GIVING AWAY, to benefit Australia's rural communities and Aussie farmers during the tough Australian drought. 
All donations counts as 1 entry, and they are about half way to their goal of sending a Semi-Trailer load of Hay and 250,000 Litres of water to the Drought Stricken areas of Australia.
