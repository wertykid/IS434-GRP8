Keegan Swenson is a badass.

How badass? Yesterday’s post of this same content was REMOVED by @instagram for going against the community guidelines for ‘self injury/graphic violence’ because the short video of his injured face was deemed inappropriate. So we are trying again, with reduced reality this time.

At the @epicrides @oztrailsoffroad Saturday morning @keegels99 crashed, broke his hand & busted open his lip. Then he got up, pinned it, and won the Pro XC. 
After that he headed straight to the emergency room for 8 stitches in his lip and a temporary wrist brace before rushing back to make the podium. Mind. Blown. 
👏👏👏👏👏
