Santa Cruz is a company of people brought together by a love of bicycles.
But bikes aren’t everything.
•
We’re deeply saddened and troubled by the events surrounding George Floyd’s death, and it’s plain to see the societal wounds it’s torn open.
•
One of our core beliefs is that bikes can be used as a force for good. We don’t just believe in quality bicycles, we believe in quality of life.
What does that mean? We work hard to find good things we can do in our communities and invest our time, sweat, and dollars to make it happen.
•
How do we, as a bike company, positively impact racial injustice and inequality?
Posting on social media’s not going to solve it, but we want to make sure our employees, athletes, and customers of color know that we support them and have their backs.
We want equality for all people, and we want justice brought to those assholes who deserve it.
•
We know the world can be better, and we’re going to be part of making that happen.
