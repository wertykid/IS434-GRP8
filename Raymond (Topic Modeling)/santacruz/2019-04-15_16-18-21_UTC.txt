Very happy to have @danny_macaskill here announce the winner of the @overcomingms/@stokedonms raffle/fundraiser.
And the winner is...(watches video)...Ciaron Walton of Cheshire, UK!!!

The one-of-a-kind #BronsonCC will be making its way over the Atlantic and into Ciaron's hands soon.
Huge thanks to everyone who donated and entered, as Â£26,319 was raised to help Andy support the battle against Multiple Sclerosis ðŸ‘Š
