Yeti / @FOX team rider @richie_rude1 is two-for-two for podium positions after placing second in todayâ€™s event. @shawnneer earned himself P31 after struggling a bit through the slick conditions.  He learned a lot today and is stoked to see what he can bring to the third @world_enduro of the season.

@kasper_woolley, still on the mend, placed 57th overall.

Up next: La Thuile.

Full race report Monday.
