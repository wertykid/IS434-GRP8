A mid-season break for Yeti/Fox Factory team rider  @shawnneer and Yeti Ambassador @leetrumpore landed the two in the idyllic Aosta Valley situated in the Italian Alps. Diverse terrain and ecosystems entertained, mountain springs and cafes meant the packs could be left at home. All in all, itâ€™s the kind of mountain bike trip dreams are made of.
