Yeti Pro Ambassador and #FollowCamFriday curator @natehills1 brings his new SB130 into the wild. “The SB130 is amazingly stable at speed - like, DH bike stable. For how long it feels initially, the rear end is short and still lets the bike feel playful. The low BB feels so sick in turns and the 77-degree seattube angle is amazing. After riding this bike, I realized I had been sitting on the tip of my saddle during climbs for years. Never have I experienced a bike that climbs well, feels stable going fast and can still turn on a dime.” #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth #SB130
