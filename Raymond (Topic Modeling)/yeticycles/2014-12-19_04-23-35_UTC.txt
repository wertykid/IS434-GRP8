Every year hundreds of Yeti Freaks from all over the world journey to the mountains of Colorado for a weekend of epic riding, tasty food, cold beer, antics, and camaraderie. This year we took the festivities down to Durango, Colorado, a place where much of Yeti’s history and roots lie.  Here we had amazing trails at our disposal and some of the best views that the state has to offer. | Check out the full video, link in profile | #YetiCycles #YetiTribe | Photo by: @davetrumporephoto
