If you haven't check out @rjripper yet - head over to his National Geographic Adventurer of the Year page linked in our bio. Each year, @NatGeo asks photographers, writers, filmmakers, and athletes to share who inspires them to reach further, go higher, and dream bigger. The publication then selects eight honorees. RJ is in that final eight. Join us as we celebrate our friend, Nepal's Mountain Bike National Champion and Yeti Ambassador. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
