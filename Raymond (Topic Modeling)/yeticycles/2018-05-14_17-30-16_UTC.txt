@richie_rude1 is back. He smashed rocks, got bloody, rode fast and even broke a smile on his way to victory at EWS 3 Montagnes du Caroux, France. He sent a clear message that you better watch the throne - he’s back on pace and looking to take the top spot again.
@duncan_nason continued to prove he’s the top young rider on the circuit, winning the day and maintaining his overall series lead. A great weekend for the Yeti Fox Factory team.
