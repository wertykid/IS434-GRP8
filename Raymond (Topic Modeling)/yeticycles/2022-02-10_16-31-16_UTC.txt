Richie Rude once again leads the Yeti / FOX Factory Race Team alongside Kasper Woolley, previously of the Yeti / OneUp Pro Team. Rounding out the 2022 Factory Team is Bex Baraona - a new addition to the Yeti family we could not be more excited about.

Riding for the National Team this year is new rider, Kate Lawrence, accompanied by Warren Kniss, who is returning to the team after multiple podiums in 2021.

Quinn Reece will be joined by Jack Brown to complete the Devo Team roster.

See you between the tape.
