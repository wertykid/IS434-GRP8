@world_enduro Round 6, Whistler kicks off at 11 am PST today. Known as one of the toughest stops in the EWS circuit, @richie_rude1 took the win in 2015 and 2016. He often dominates on one of the longest and most technical stages, Top of the World. Richie, @shawnneer and @duncan_nason will all be toeing the line. Teammate @jubaldavis was able to practice yesterday, but his thumb isn't quite ready for a day of grueling racing. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
