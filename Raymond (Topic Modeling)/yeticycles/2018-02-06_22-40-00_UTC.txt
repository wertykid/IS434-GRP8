Yeti Cycles ambassador, @joeyschusler is back at it. In the third and final installment of the @Freehub series, The Art of Adventure the once professional racer turned photographer, videographer and adventurer takes us on the wild Colorado River for a bike pack rafting mini adventure on public lands. Joey gives a little insight on these shorter adventures close to home. Go to Freehub to see this video and the others that tell Joey's story. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
