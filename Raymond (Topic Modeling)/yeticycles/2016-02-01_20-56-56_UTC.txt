"Nepal isn’t easy to get to and that’s part of the adventure. Fortunately, I would be met on the other end by the crew from H&I Adventures — all Yeti freaks and the world’s best mountain bike travel company. I would also be greeted by twenty-five Yeti riders, affectionately called the tribe, who had traveled from the US, UK, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Indonesia. It was truly humbling to spend our 30th Anniversary in Nepal with this diverse group of Yeti owners — I was incredibly stoked." Link in our profile to Nepal excursion.
