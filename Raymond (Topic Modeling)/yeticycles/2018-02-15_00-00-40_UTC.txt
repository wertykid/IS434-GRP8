The cold sucks, but so does not riding. We have to fight our instincts to set the bike aside and hibernate during the winter season. We could easily migrate south to avoid the inevitable. Or we could throw on a few more layers to explore deeper into the woods through a different lens. To fight off hibernation, Yeti Ambassadors @yetibetisarah and @reubenkrabbe head to Whistler B.C. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
