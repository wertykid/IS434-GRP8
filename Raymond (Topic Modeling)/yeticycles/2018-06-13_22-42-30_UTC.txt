Yeti ambassador, racer and the man behind #FollowCamFriday, @natehills1 was one of the first ambassadors to order up a SB100. Since Nate mainly focuses on enduro racing and shredding the most technical trails he can sniff out, we were waiting with somewhat bated breath to see his final build. It did not disappoint. For all you #bikenerds out there, here is his SB100 spec run down. "I built my 100 for light enduro\ down country use. I am running @srammtb Eagle XX1, Guide Ultimate brakes 180mm front and rear. The fork is a 130mm Pike that slackens the bike to about 67 degrees. I slapped a 36T chainring for max output and 150mm reverb seat post. Current tires are @maxxistires 2.5 Minnion DHF, 2.3 Aggressor combo on Roval Traverse SL Carbon 31mm id wheels. Final details are a 750mm wide bars, 50mm stem, MRP 1X chainguide and @ergonbike GD1 grips and saddle." Nate took this rig to Moab @endurocupmtb and placed second. We think that speaks for itself. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
