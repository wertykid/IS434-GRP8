@shawnneer, @jubaldavis and @natehills1 stacked the podium in first, third and fourth at the @bigmountainenduro in Crested Butte, CO. AND, they were all on different bikes. Shawn chose the SB6 for the win. Jubal stuck to the SB55 for a combination of big wheels and plush travel. Nate went light and fast with the SB100.

Devo riders @quinnreece and @brynnerthepinner, both just 17-years-old, cracked the Top 10 in 6th and 7th place overall. Weâ€™re looking forward to watching these guys progress. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
