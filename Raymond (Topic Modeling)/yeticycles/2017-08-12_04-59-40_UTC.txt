It's dry, dusty and smoky for @world_enduro Round 7 in Whistler, Canada. Highly unusual for this normally loamy track. We can't help but to crack smiles when we see the forecast for rain over the weekend. What has been a bit of a curse for EWS this season, may bring much needed traction back to @richie_rude1 favorite run - Top of the World. Stay tuned. #YetiCycles #MoreThanMyth #RideDriven P: @davetrumporephoto
