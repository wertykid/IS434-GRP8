Second 1-2-3 finish of the season.
 
The team took home the top three spots on the box in the Pro-Men category and young-gun @lauren_bingham_ took home a 4th place win in the Pro-Women’s field.
 
The tiny town of Ironton, MO is unassuming and not somewhere you would first think of for a bike park. However small, the 600 vertical feet bike park served up some proper technical jank for the first @bigmountainenduro of the 2021 race season.
