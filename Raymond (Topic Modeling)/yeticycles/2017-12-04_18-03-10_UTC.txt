When two like-minded companies @yeticycles and @opencycle share the same design philosophy – “building bikes we want to ride” Great things happen. Today, we are launching the all-new Yeti-inspired NEW U.P. frameset in iconic Yeti turquoise. The NEW U.P., for Unbeaten Path, is an all-carbon frame that combines the geometry of a road-riding position with the clearance for cross and mountain bike tires – up to 27.5 x 2.1 inches. The outcome is a bike capable of taking on asphalt, gravel roads or singletrack. Available at Open dealers and online. Check out the link in our bio.
