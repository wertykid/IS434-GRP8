The SB100 is a strong XC climbing machine, but the gravity inspired geometry, 120mm @Fox 34 Step-Cast fork and meaty tires are all trail. The result is a perfect blend of pedaling efficiency with downhill prowess. It's the bike of choice for Yeti pro rider, @geoffkabush, as he defends his titles at the @BCBikeRace and Downieville Classic.
