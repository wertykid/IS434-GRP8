Squamish-Whistler-Pemberton-Abbotsford-Vancouver-Squamish â€“ this would be our planned route. A mixture of singletrack, brutal climbs, fire road and hitchhiking. We assembled our usual motley crew Yeti Ambassadors @rossmeasures and myself @reubenkrabbe, and our buddy @tobinseagel - with the objective of riding as much singletrack we could find. We knew avoiding all the asphalt would be impossible, but we are also keenly familiar with the hospitality of Canadians and placed a heavy bet. -Reuben Krabbe, Yeti ambassador and photographer takes on a hitching and riding adventure with buddies.
