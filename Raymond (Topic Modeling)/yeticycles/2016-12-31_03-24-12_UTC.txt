While the SB5.5c may have been born from racing, itâ€™s reliability and performance transferred right over to this style of bikepacking adventure. Coupled with some Revelate Designs bikepacking bags, ENVE wheels, and fresh off the press SRAM Eagle drivetrain we were fully kitted to go light and fast to the best of our abilities.  Throughout the entire 11 days we were lucky enough to only experience one mechanical, an easy fix, a flat tire. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #SB55
