Sunday marks the end of the @world_enduro season for the Yeti/FOX race team. The one-day race in Finale Ligure, Italy promises a big day in the saddle for @richie_rude1 and teammate @shawnneer, with 52 KM (32 miles) of riding covering potentially well over 2,000 meters (6,000 feet) of climbing. No uplifts - all pedal-powered. Tune in Sunday afternoon for final results.
