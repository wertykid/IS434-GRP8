Two days of practice are in the bag with two days of racing on deck at @bigmountainenduro Big Sky.

Daily rains have made practice days highly variable with muddy, slick morning laps followed by the dry, loose terrain that Big Sky is known for.

The first four stages kick off tomorrow, with 4,015 ft of climbing and 4,132 ft of descent. Tune in tomorrow to see how day one unfolds. Itâ€™s bound to be fast and loose.
