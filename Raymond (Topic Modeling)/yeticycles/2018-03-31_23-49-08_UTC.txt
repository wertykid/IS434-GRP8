@duncan_nason (U21) and crew take on the final seven stages of the second stop on the @world_enduro in Colombia tomorrow. Stage 1 was held on the streets of Manizales with 5,000 fans cheering Duncan to a third place finish. With it being such a short, and high consequence stage, all Yeti Fox riders are still in striking distance. Tomorrow the real race begins. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
