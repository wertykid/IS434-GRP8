A typical year for Yeti / @fox Factory Team athlete, Shawn Neer consists of 6 months of traveling the world racing on some of the most physically and mentally daunting tracks the @world_enduro has to offer. Shawn has taken to his backyard trails in absence of his usual international racing schedule. Repetition breeds muscle memory and speed that toes the line between fast as hell and dangerous.

"As much of a bummer covid turned out to be in 2020. The silver lining turned out to be heaps more time training on local trails for race prep. I have never felt better on my bike and couldn't be more excited to get between the tape again. Bring on the race nerves and adrenaline. Looking forward to the 2021 race season with Richie and the team!" - @shawnneer
