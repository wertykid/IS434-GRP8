Local Colorado ambassador, Britt Greer, loves coaching. And that’s a significant understatement. Her love for the sport seeps through every part of her day, the multiple organizations she supports, and dozens of women she coaches and mentors. In this episode of TYTM @martyschaffer and @brittdgreer discuss her passion for bringing mountain bikes to underserved communities, where coaching has lead her, and the multitude of great “Front Country” (thanks, Marty) trails to learn on.
