Fall in Colorado harkens back to the days of origin of our home state. Like the pioneers before us, we go in search of gold in the form of fall leaves and trails just drying from late summer rain or early winter snow. We teeter between seasons and are rewarded. Yeti Ambassador, @sarahvirginiauhl finds her gold among the aspen of Crested Butte aboard the SB5 Beti in the new Monarch Jersey and W's Enduro Shorts.
