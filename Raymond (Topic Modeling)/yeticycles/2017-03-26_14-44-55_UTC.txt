Well the mud, rain, and humidity were a challenge in Rotorua but riding bikes in still fun. @richie_rude1 rode out some thrashed trails to a 20th place. Being the last man down each stage today had its disadvantages. He will likely be looking forward to some sun and dust at the next stop in Australia. #YetiCycles #RideDriven ⠀
