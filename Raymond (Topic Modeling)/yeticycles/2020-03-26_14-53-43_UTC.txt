“Ten times a day I get asked, 'Which Yeti Should I buy?' and I always struggle to answer.

Everyone is looking for that elusive unicorn bike — one that climbs like an XC rig and descends like a downhill bike. But I think we can all agree that this unicorn will never actually exist. That said, this is the closest thing I have found that lets me experience big days on technical terrain while not having to hold back one bit on the descents. The SB130LR is my idea of the perfect trail bike. It’s got the proper geometry and a perfect blend of efficiency and capability for the terrain I enjoy riding most. The coil out back just adds to the party.

My everyday smash wagon. SB130LR.” - @natehills1
