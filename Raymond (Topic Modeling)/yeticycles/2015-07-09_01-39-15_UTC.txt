Colorado Trail Day 4, Breckenridge to Copper. Unseasonable rains in CO have made for a very solemn, cold, and wet few days on the Colorado Trail. The deep fog makes crossing the 12,000' passes mysterious only able to see a few feet in front of you. A vast expanse of mountains and backcountry scenery lay hidden in the layers of clouds, waiting for the sun to illuminate their beauty.
