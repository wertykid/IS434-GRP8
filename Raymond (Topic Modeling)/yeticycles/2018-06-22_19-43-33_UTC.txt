Thank you to everyone who attended screenings of @joeyschusler's newest short film, RJ Ripper at Yeti HQ and around the Front Range. At the Yeti HQ event, thanks to your generosity, we were able to raise more than $8,000 that will go directly to @RJRipper to support his visa bid to race internationally. If you were unable to attend a screening but want to support RJ, following the link in our bio to contribute to his Go Fund Me account. Check back in with us on Monday to see the film online. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth #RJRipperFilm
