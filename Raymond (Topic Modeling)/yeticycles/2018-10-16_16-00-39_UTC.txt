When @stu_dickson throws a leg over a bike, he means business. Berm slapping and big hucks are his M.O. Stu set out with @reubenkrabbe and @mmlazarski in an attempt to conquer 7 peaks in 7 days and the SB150 was the ideal choice for big climbs and gravity-fed lines of the southern Canadian Rockies. Although the original Summit Quest plan wasn't to be, Stu had plenty of chances to point it down hill and give 'er. Check out the Summit Quest feature by visiting the link in our bio.
