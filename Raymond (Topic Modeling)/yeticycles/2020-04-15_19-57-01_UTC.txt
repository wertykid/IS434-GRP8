We are humbled by the outpouring of support from the Tribe, both near and far. As we continue to receive messages from those in need, we've been able to source additional plastic and materials. With these additions, we are doubling our commitment and will now produce 20,000 face shields. This is a group effort made possible by our hardworking employees, industry friends at @smithoptics @blackdiamond  and @vcgraphix_ , and the community working to spread the word.

It’s our responsibility to step up to support our friends and neighbors when they need it most. When this is all over, we can show our gratitude over a cold one. Until then, let’s keep our frontline and health care providers protected.
