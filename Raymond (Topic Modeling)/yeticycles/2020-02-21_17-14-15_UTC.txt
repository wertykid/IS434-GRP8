Dan is about as far from an “influencer” as you get. In a social climate where it feels like everything is created for a like, @danmilnerphoto forges his path in dirt, rain (sometimes snow), sweat, and a hell of a lot of grit. Forgoing the “easy” shot in favor of capturing moments where the human element, perseverance, and mountain bikes meet.
