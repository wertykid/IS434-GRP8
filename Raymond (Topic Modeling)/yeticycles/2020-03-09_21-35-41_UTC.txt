Yeti Ambassador Laura Slavin is no stranger to sending it, and now she has the perfect rig to do just that. “I wanted to put together a bike that was capable of handling the biggest park hits I could throw at it but still light and nimble enough for someone my size to flick around with ease. This bike is everything I’ve always wanted!” - @thatslavintho
