Equipped with a heavy dose of nostalgia that conjures a rare sort of lust, the ARC 35th Anniversary Edition is a 1-of-100 hardtail with all of the modern magic of today, thrown all the way back. While the ARC has roots back to the early beginnings of Yeti, this frame is anything but a blast from the past. A classic colorway anodized up the ying-yang.
