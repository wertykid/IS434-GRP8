The iconic Mt Cook is New Zealand's highest peak, knows as Aoraki to the native Maori people. While the destination is primarily known by adventure seekers for rock climbing, the steep paths hidden among the tussock grass provide for some untamed and challenging downhills runs. The hike back up the pitches forces one to take pause at the top, sometimes to catch your breath, but more so to enjoy the view after each successive ride down.
