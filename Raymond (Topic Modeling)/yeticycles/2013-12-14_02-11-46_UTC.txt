Don't call us between 11:30 and 1:00. We won't be here. Every day, weather permitting, we shut our doors, turn on the answering machine and head out for a ride at lunch. With the headquarters situated at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, our local trails are just a few pedal stokes away. This daily opportunity to get out and ride is a large part of why many started working here, but at the same time, it allows us to test and refine new models, try out component spec, or just drop the boss on a climb. It is core to the process behind the bikes we design and manufacture.
