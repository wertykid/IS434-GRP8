YETI FREAKS! The 17th Annual Yeti Tribe Gathering is heading back to Aspen. Slated for July 27 - 29, Tribe returns to its origins, where the very first gathering transpired on the flanks of Fanny Hill in Snowmass Village, Colorado. @YetiBetiSarah has another leg burner, lung buster of a ride planned and the wild flowers should be in their prime. Link to purchase tickets in our bio. Get 'er done.
