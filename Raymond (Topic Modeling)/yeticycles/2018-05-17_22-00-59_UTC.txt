Betis - Beti Tribe Scotland is on. We want you, yes you - to join us. Colorado Beti @rgottfried joined us on our last International Beti Tribe Gathering in New Zealand. Here is what she had to say: "My @mountainbikeworldwide trip to New Zealand was my first experience on a guided trip, and it outlived my expectations in every way. I began the trip as an intermediate rider, slightly nervous about the riding difficulty and hours on the bike. It turned out everyone had the same nerves, and our guides worked with us to make sure the group started and ended the day with positive vibes, adjusting routes to account for our abilities and weather. I came home with stronger legs, more fitness, and a group of friends I now call family. The time and energy H&I put into this trip was evidentâ€” sign me up for the next adventure!" - Rachel Gottfried (Arvada, CO)
