Cool fall mornings have us remembering back to a cold mid-summer day in the Tobacco Roots range. A few hours after Yeti Ambassador @stephen_matthews descended down from Branham Peaks it snowed a couple feet. Relegating us to the lower elevations for several days, well that is life in Montana. #YetiCycles #ProvenHere
