The game makers were hard at work this weekend for Round 4 of the EWS in Austria and Slovenia and served up as promised, one of the most challenging stops in the history of the series. After 96.5 km (59.6 miles), 2,732 meters (8,963 feet) of climbing and  5,026 meters (16,489 feet) of descending over two days and two countries, the best riders in the world were worse for the wear. Sprained ankles, broken thumbs (@jubaldavis - heal up quick friend) and plenty of OTBs were tallied. At the end of day, @richie_rude1 and @shawnneer finished in mostly one piece 21st and 28th, respectively. We'll dust ourselves off and set sights for Round 5.
