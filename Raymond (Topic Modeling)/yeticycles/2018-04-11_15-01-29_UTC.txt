Walk around the halls at Yeti and youâ€™ll find women who can tear your legs off on the uphill and mock you on the downhill. The SB100 Beti quickly gained a reputation for its climbing ability and for how it descends. It's our genre-killing 100 mm trail machine, built for your next #ladyshred adventure. #YetiCycles #YetiBeti #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
