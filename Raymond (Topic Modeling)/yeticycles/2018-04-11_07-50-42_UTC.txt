This is what we can do with short travel and our newly configured Switch Infinity. It transcends the weight-weenie, uphill only models and replaces it with a precision riding bike. If some people assume it's a downhiller's XC bike, whateverâ€¦ Call it what you want. For us, it's simply the bike we always wanted to build. The SB100. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth #NewBikeDay
