The Betis are well into their voyage on the first-annual Yeti Beti International Tribe Gathering in New Zealand. Having conquered the trails of Hanmer, St. James and Old Ghost Road - the ladies are on their way to Craigieburn and five more days of epic riding. The next Beti Tribe is in Scotland this Sept.
