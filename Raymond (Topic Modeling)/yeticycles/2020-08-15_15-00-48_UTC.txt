The first @crankworx Summer Series is a wrap. Yeti athlete @kasper_woolley landed a podium spot in 6 of 9 events he raced. He placed 6th overall, competing against some tough competition aboard his SB150 - including the DH and Air DH events.

Keep an eye out for Kasper at the BME next weekend in Big Sky, Montana.
