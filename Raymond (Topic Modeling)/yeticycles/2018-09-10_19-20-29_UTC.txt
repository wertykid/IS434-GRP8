One bike that rules - SB130.

Yeti's proven Switch Infinity suspension is improved with new kinematics and more progressive geometry. The 77-degree seat tube angle and big wheels make it an unapologetic climber. Slightly shorter chainstays, slack headtube angle, long reach and a 44 mm offset fork ensures itâ€™s flick-able and playful, but still rages on the downhill. Follow the link in our bio to learn more.
