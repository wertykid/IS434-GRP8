@justin_reiter recounts his experience on the 500 mile Colorado Trail thru-ride that he completed last summer with some fellow Yeti Ambassadors, "The days and miles passed. Some slower than others. And others not slow enough. Adventures like this calm the mind, rekindle to simple love for riding, and will certainly never be forgotten by those who experience them.” | Full story and video online next Wednesday. | @justin_reiter @craigjones250 @sam_seward @joeyschusler | #YetiTribe #ColoradoTrail #ARCc #ASRc
