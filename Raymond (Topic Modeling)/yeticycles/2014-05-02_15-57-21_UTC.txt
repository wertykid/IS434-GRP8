After the fist race of the season @jaredgravesmtb and @richie_rude1 stuck around to enjoy the amazing trails and scenery. It's all about flow in Nevados De Chill√°n, Chile. Each trail the team rode seemed to get better than the last as they twisted and turned, almost effortlessly, though the forest and into the valley below. | #YetiCycles | Photo by @davetrumporephoto
