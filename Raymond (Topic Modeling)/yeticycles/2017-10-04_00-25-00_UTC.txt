A tough season of racing is behind Yeti Pro rider @richie_rude1. For the first time in three years the @world_enduro men's title was earned by a rider not on the Yeti Fox Factory team. Huge congrats to @samhill13, @ravanel_mtb and all the racers on another stellar season of riding and pushing limits on the toughest tracks in the world. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
