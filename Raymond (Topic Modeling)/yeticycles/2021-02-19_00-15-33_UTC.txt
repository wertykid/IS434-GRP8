Every now and then, someone passes through your life and their positive energy is so strong that everyone around them is affected. Sam Schneider, a Yeti staffer, was that guy. He was stoked on life and mountain biking above all else. No matter the situation, he always found the sliver of positivity (or even the whole slice) embraced it, and spent his 20 years making everyone around him smile. We’d all benefit from taking a page from Sam’s book. 

Sam lost his battle with cancer earlier this week, and we’re still trying to wrap our heads around it. We’ll remember his kind spirit, his infectious smile, and we know he’s shredding heavenly trails. Rest in Peace, Sam. You will be missed.
