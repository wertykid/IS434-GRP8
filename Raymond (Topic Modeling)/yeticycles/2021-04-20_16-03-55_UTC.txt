Laura Slavin's journey from chemist to cyclist started on a basic commuter bike as she tried to be more environmentally conscience as her way to get toÂ and from work. That was in 2013. Now, Laura  is hucking it with the best on her home trails at Mountain Creek, New Jersey. In this episode, @martyschaffer and @thatslavintho talk about her drive to be a better person, her passion for riding and just how committed she is to the art of progression. #TalkYetiToMe
