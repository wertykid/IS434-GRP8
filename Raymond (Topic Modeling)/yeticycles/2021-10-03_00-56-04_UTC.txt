One of the closes title chases in EWS history came to an anticlimactic end today at EWS.9 Tweed Valley. We are absolutely gutted about the season-ending UCI ruling regarding @richie_rude1’s Pro Stage run.

Yeti / @FOX teammate @shawnneer and @kasper_woolley placed 25th and 21st respectively in today’s Pro Stage and are ready for four more stages of rain, mud, and slick roots tomorrow.
