Late day rain in Canazei lead to a last-minute swap for todayâ€™s Pro Stage. As all practice on this stage was dry, no one knew how the new track would ride wet. Rather than a conservative run, Rude made the call to fully send it. And it paid off. He put five seconds over the second-place finish.

Tune in tomorrow to see how @richie_rude1, @shawnneer, and @kasper_woolley do.
