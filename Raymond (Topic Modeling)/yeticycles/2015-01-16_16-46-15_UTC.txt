We only got to scratch the surface of the trails at Izoard, trails that on the map run out in every direction for tens of miles. For me as the photographer, the bad weather actually served up a lot more atmosphere than we'd have had with sunshine, really helping pick out the rock formations. For Jared and Richie, they got to throw the bikes around on some very loose corners that felt more like the Dolomites than the Alps. | #YetiCycles #SwitchInfinity #SB5c | Riders: @jaredgravesmtb & @richie_rude1 Photo: Dan Milner
