Things are starting to pick up here for 6th round of the @world_enduro in Whistler, Canada. Five burly stages of racing will be jam-packed into one day of racing on Sunday. @jaredgravesmtb is the defending champion here but only time will tell if he can match his incredible performance from last year. | #YetiCycles #SwitchInfinity #SB6C #Crankworx | Photo by @joeyschusler
