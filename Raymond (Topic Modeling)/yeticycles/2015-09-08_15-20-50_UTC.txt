In celebration of our 30th Anniversary, weâ€™re releasing a limited run of 250 SB6c bikes. Featuring classic Yeti turquoise and yellow race colors, the SB6c is the ultimate enduro race bike. The graphics are a nod to our past, the completely redesigned SB6c frame with 148 boost and internally routed cables are rooted in the future. Link in Bio. #yeticycles #SB6c
