La Grave is not known as a mountain bike Mecca. It's steep and unforgiving. In the winter it's two curious lifts hurl backcountry skiers straight into 10,000ft off-piste descents that dodge glacial crevasses and seracs. In summer, its five dedicated trails carry a similar feel: committing. But, just outside the resort, we found trails that oozed flow like an over-ripe Brie. | #YetiCycles #SwitchInfinity #SB5c | Riders: @jaredgravesmtb & @richie_rude1 Photo: Dan Milner
