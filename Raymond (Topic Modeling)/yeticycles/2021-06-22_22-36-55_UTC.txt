It’s been almost two years since we have raced on the world stage. The team is hungry to see exactly how they stack up against the most competitive roster at the first @world_enduro of the 2021 race season. The extended off-season stands to split the field between those who remained laser-focused on blistering track speed - from those who haven’t.

Last time @richie_rude1 raced here, he dominated the field with a win 18-second margin, winning 4-of-5 stages, and teammate @shawnneer finished an impressive 18th. This is @kasper_woolley ’s first time at this venue while racing on the Yeti / OneUp Pro Team, and we are stoked to see what he can do.

Tune in tomorrow.
