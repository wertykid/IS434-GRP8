Current Junior Downhill World Champion @richie_rude1 had never raced a big enduro event before this past weekends @world_enduro in Chile. While he didn’t get the exact result he was gunning for, he still had quite a respectable showing for being the new kid on the block. Look for Richie to be climbing the ranks throughout the season. The kid is a powerhouse on the bike. | #YetiCycles #SB66C
