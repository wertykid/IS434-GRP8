Race season is upon us as the Tennessee National kicks off this Friday. @richie_rude1 and @shawnneer once again will bolt on the number plates for the Yeti / @FOX Factory Race Team.

Longtime Factory Team mechanic, @yetipolarbear, and National Team mechanic, Mark Hild return to ensure the crew’s bikes are tuned and race-ready. Race Team Manager, @damions, will continue to do what he always does keep the team organized and prepared to race while scouring the field for up-and-coming talent. Who knows, maybe the next Yeti rider comes out of Tennessee…

Stay tuned as the Yeti / FOX Team competes in their first enduro of the year on Sunday. And watch as Rude pilots a DH #SB165 in the downhill event on Saturday.
