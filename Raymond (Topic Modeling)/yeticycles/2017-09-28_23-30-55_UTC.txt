@richie_rude1 gets some practice time between the tape for the final stop of the @world_enduro series in Finale Ligure, Italy. The riding in Finale is hard to describe. The trails in the lower foothills are loose, rocky and exposed. Up high it is equally rocky, but some trails offer more traction, the corners are tight and there are plenty of trees that can grab handlebars. Overall, the riding is technical, challenging and unpredictable. The outcome is the appropriate setting to put the world's best riders to the ultimate and final test. Racing starts Saturday. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMythâ €
