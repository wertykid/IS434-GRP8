After blowing a tire on his first run, @reedboggs knew exactly what he needed to do for his second attempt. Boggs cleaned his second run with confidence, style, and ease – nailing every drop and trick he set out to attempt. He knew it, and so did the judges. That run earned him his first ever Rampage podium, claiming third overall amongst some of the biggest legends in freeride.

Boggs is no longer a name that you will find on the alternate list. After this past weekend, Reed has officially arrived.

“This year is a statement. I just want to prove to these guys that I deserve to be in the mix.”
