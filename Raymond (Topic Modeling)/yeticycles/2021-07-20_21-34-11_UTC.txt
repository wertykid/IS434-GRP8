Last year was a breakout year for @kasper_woolley, beating some of the biggest names in Enduro racing, and to us, that’s not a surprise. Woolley’s bred from a pedigree of fast (his dad was on the National Ski Team), and Kasper competitively raced on the cold white stuff for years before focusing on biking. Who said the multi-sport athlete is dead? We didn’t. In this episode, Marty and Kasper talk everything from bike setup, skiing and how Kasper has always been fighting more than just the clock.
