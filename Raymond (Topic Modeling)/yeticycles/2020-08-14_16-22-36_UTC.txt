As mountain bikers, we are keenly aware of the risks. Our President has said it many times over “it’s not about if you get hurt, it’s about when.”
 
@yeticycles demo driver @leah.vanderlinden suffered a broken femur and tibia in October 2019 and has undergone multiple surgeries and countless hours of PT. In less than 10 months she has gone from a walker to full-send, taking first place in the Pro Women’s Air DH at the Trestle Gravity.
 
Recovery takes focus, determination, and grit. Injuries happen, and when they do, be like Leah. She is nothing short of a badass.
