What a week for Yeti Pro Racer @geoffkabush at the @bcbikerace. Kabush took the win, with a final ride time of 15 hours 18 mins and 22 seconds, beating second place by 6 minutes and 30 seconds. Kabush is taking a bit of R&R time this week to rest his legs for the XC Nationals this coming weekend and Downieville Classic the first weekend of August. The @breckepic will be his next stage race, where plenty of type-two fun will be had. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth P:@margusriga
