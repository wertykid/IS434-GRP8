The Yeti SB5.5 is the beast of choice for @richie_rude1, @jubaldavis and @duncan_nason on the Yeti/Fox Factory Team for the @world_enduro, @bigmountainenduro and @endurocupmtb circuits. Duncan leads the EWS series for U21 men and Richie is sitting well within striking distance in 12th. The team leaves next week for Austria for the fourth round of the EWS. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
