Two years have passed since @richie_rude1 tackled the tracks in La Thuile, Italy. Joined this season by @shawnneer and @duncan_nason, the team looks in fighting shape for a weekend of long, steep descents on a playground of trails nestled below the foreboding Mont Blanc. Often a favorite stop of many riders, Richie took the win in 2016. Here's to a repeat of that performance. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
