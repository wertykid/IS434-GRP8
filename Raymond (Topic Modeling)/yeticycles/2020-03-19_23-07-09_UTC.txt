With all the uncertainty in the world, there are some things that remain constant. We’ve spent the last 35 years surrounded by a world-class crew we refer to as the Yeti Tribe. They’ve gotten us through epic rides after we’ve cracked and struggled to get home, we’ve shared more than few beers and they’ve provided friendship in good times and bad.

We all need a Tribe now. We all need to have each other’s back. We encourage everyone to stay safe, be sensible, and power on. We’re up for the challenge. We’re mountain bikers, after all.
