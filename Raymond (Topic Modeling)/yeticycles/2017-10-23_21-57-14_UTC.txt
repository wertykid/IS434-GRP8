As @joeyschusler and his merry group of bandits woke up on Saturday morning in the Guinn Mountain Hut on the top of the Continental Divide, snow was not what they expected. But weather in the high alpine is unpredictable. The only solution was to suit up and ride to Winter Park for warm drinks, breakfast and park laps. The MegaRide marches on. ⠀
