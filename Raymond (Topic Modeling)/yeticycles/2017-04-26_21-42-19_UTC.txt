The SB5 was the perfect bike for the Whitefish and the surrounding Flathead Forest. The versatility of the platform allowed us to handle bike park trails, epic climbs, and meandering through the woods for secret stashes. If you could only have one @yeticycles this might be it. #YetiCycles #YetiSB5 â €
