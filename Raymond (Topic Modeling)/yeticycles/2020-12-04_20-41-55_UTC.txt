“It was an absolute honor riding with and getting to know @eliotjackson while working on the fundraising initiative to benefit @growcyclingfoundation. It is refreshing to see the bike industry come together in support of an amazing cause, and I couldn’t be more proud to be a part of this campaign. More kids on bikes!“ - Nate Hills
