Lab and track tested to downhill standards, the SB6 has the most stage wins of any EWS bike to date and is built to take a beating. New for 2019, we’ve added tunneled internal tubes for easier service in the pits. The @Fox 36, 170mm spec’d fork with a 37 mm offset ensures this bike is uniquely suited for taking on big terrain. Backed by Yeti's No-B.S. Lifetime Warranty.
