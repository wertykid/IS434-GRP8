Yeti Ambassador @morse.ah defines Yeti’s ride driven philosophy. A mechanical engineer by trade, mountain biking has always been the catalyst behind how he spends his free time. This year, he took on the ultimate challenge to race the entire @world_enduro series, while keeping his full-time job. He’s found ways to make it all work, including his training grounds at the rustic @boltonvalley Ski resort in his home state of Vermont that keep his skills sharp. Episode 2 is live now on @pinkbike.
