Friends - our doors will be closed in Golden today at 2:30 P.M. for the remainder of the day as we remember our friend Anthony Sloan for our annual Tuk Tuk Ride. We can't think of a better way to honor those who have moved on, than to throw a leg over two wheels and cheers at the top. #YetiCycles #MoreThanMyth
