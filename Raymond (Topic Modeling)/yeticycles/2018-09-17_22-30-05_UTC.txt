@geoffkabush rode the SB100 to victory in its native land yesterday for the first-ever third annual @goldengiddyup. The proceeds from the local race help support ongoing trail stewardship efforts in the region, resulting in thousands of hours of trail work by mountain bikers. Oh, and everyone gets a bottle of whiskey at the finish. Now, that's our kind of race. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #SB100 #ShapeWhatYourShred #GoldenGiddyUp
