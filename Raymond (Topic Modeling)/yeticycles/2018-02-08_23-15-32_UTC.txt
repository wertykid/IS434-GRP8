Yeti Cycles is thrilled to add Canadian three-time Olympian and all-around multi-talented @geoffkabush to the race roster for 2018. Kabush will focus on endurance, trail and stage race events for the season defending titles @bcbikerace, @transcascadia, and the Downieville Classic. As well as the dubious honor of undefeated arm wrestling champ at Blitz to Bend. Kabush is Yeti through and through and did we mention he can take a punch? Welcome to the Tribe, buddy. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth  Photos: @reubenkrabbe
