The @goldengiddyup is one of our favorite local events. Hosted on the trails in our backyard, the race is the culmination of months of trail work, hence the motto #ShapeWhatYouShred. With the new year upon us, we hope weâ€™ll see you all out there either here in Golden, CO or at home on your trails giving back.
