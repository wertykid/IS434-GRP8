Known as the "Yading Kora," @joeyschusler, @sam_seward and @bricemag set out to complete a multi-day pilgrimage around three peaks in southwest China and Tibet. These peaks are deemed sacred by a number of Dalai Lamas and it is said completing this Kora will negate a lifetime of negative karma. 
The Kora, a film by Joey Schusler, launches tomorrow.
