Yeti ambassador @nicholekbaker is back in Uganda and has spent the past couple of weeks releasing a reporting and informatics system to speed up the diagnosis of cancer across all public laboratories in the country. Check out her trip report from last year, State of Flow (link in bio). Today she leaves the capital Kampala by way of bike, 250 miles to Mbarara Uganda. Along the way, she'll safely distribute solar lights to rural villages without electricity, and will complete her trip teaching at the medical school. Be sure to follow along!

Note: This photo was taken last year. This year additional steps will be taken to make the light distribution process safe with covid-19 in mind.
