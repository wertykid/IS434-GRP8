“I went out of my comfort zone to be prepared for this Rampage. I feel like I’m ready for this - it’s everything I have been practicing and working toward. Everybody is hungry, everybody has a really sick line and wants to do well. It is going to come down to who looks like they are having the most fun. And I think that’s going to be me.” - @reedboggs
