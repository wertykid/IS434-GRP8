A sighting of the elusive Yeti was had by all today before we descended down @aspensnowmass and across the Roaring Fork Valley. We covered 30+ miles through a mixture of ecosystems with all our favorite riding buddies. Yeti Tribe never disappoints. #YetiTribe2018 #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
