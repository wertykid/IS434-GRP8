Let this sink in, the SB6 has more stage, race and overall wins, including back-to-back EWS World Championships, than any other bike on the Enduro World Series circuit. Racing is our legacy, heritage and the cornerstone of what we do. We race to win. The limited edition SB6TR is your chance to ride the same bike as two-time EWS Champ Richie Rude. Hung with the best parts from longtime Factory Team sponsors like Fox, Shimano, DT Swiss, Renthal, Chris King, Maxxis, One-Up and Ergon this bike pulverizes EWS race tracks around the world and put our athletes atop podiums. Check it out on the Yeti website this week when new bikes drop. ⠀
