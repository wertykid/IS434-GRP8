Almost 500 miles from Denver to Durango the Colorado Trail threads its way over eight spectacular mountain ranges, with lakes, creeks and diverse ecosystems. This was early in the trip when spirits were high and food stores full. Over the course of the next two weeks Yeti ambassadors @joeyschusler, @sam_seward, and @justin_reiter encountered thunderstorms, epic singletrack, hunger pains and more. The beautiful Colorado scenery pulling them along the whole way. #YetiCycles #RideDriven ⠀
