"The Kazakh nomads of Western Mongolia, move from place to place as the seasons, farming and hunting determine. They live in what we would call yurts - in their language "Gers" and they move them piece by piece, tapestry by tapestry on their horses and camels. As we rode by, locals would often invite us in, proud to show us their homes and share local delicacies like fermented mare's milk served along side stale sweets. We sat with the elders, ate and communicated as best we could. Of course, the kids would ride our bikes around outside and marvel at parts and components that looked so foreign to them. When we rode away, our lives stuffed into bikepacking bags it was clear to us how a simpler life can often bring the most happiness." - Yeti Ambassador @joeyschusler from #FlashesOfTheAltai, link to film in profile.
