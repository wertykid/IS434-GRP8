Yeti Ambassador, @jasonfitzgibbon is a wildlife biologist that spends his days as the co-founder and environmental director @tillakgoods where he develops and manages the Goods That Give Back program. Jason got his first mountain bike when he was 12, purchased with lawn mowing money and a little assistance from his dad. Since that day, he's worked tirelessly to preserve singletrack as he saw his favorite So Cal trails overtaken by tract housing and strip malls. In his role as a photographer and director @zangsfilms, Jason tells the stories of people and places preserving open space. . "It is my belief that the collective voice of the mountain bike community and the economic potential of mountain biking can be effectively leveraged to advocate for more open space and more trails. Keep an eye out for a film coming soon about the coastal town of Bandon, Oregon, and some of the new trails they’re putting in."
