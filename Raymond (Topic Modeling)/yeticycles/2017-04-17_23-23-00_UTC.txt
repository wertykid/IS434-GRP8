The descent is another Trans Andes stage through volcanic sand that transitions to a snaking technical mountain traverse into a high-speed swoop through loamy switchbacks. Despite trying to maintain mach speeds, we stop at the viewpoint. It’s not a race. Everyone is here for the love of the ride. For more on the trip, link in bio.#YetiTribe #RideDriven ⠀
