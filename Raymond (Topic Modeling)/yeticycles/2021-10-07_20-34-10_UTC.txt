Durango holds a special place in Yeti’s heritage, so it’s fitting that the resurrection and return of the event should be in Durango as well. The spirit of the San Juan’s, built by the gold rush and maintained by an ongoing optimism and love for the outdoors, keeps Durango special. It’s the perfect spot for us Yeti Freaks to gather, find common ground and remind each other that the brand is about the people, not just the bikes. 

In this episode of TYTM, @martyschaffer chats with a few of the people who make The Gathering the event that it is.
