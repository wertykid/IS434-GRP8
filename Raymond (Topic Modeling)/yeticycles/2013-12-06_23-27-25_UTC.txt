The Yeti Tribe is a diverse group that shares our same devotion to owning and riding great bikes. Liz joined the tribe at the start of last summer when she got her first Yeti. Riding at any chance she could, her skills have improved incredibly in just a few short months. More importantly, she has learned how to have an incredible amount of fun on her bike each and every time she hits the trail. | #YetiCycles #SB66C #YetiTribe @long_live_lemon
