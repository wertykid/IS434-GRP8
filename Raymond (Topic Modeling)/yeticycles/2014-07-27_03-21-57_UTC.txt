Another great day for the team and their Switch Infinity equipped bikes. While @richie_rude1 won both stages yesterday, @jaredgravesmtb won all three today. Jared is sitting in first overall going into the final day of racing with Richie sitting in second. Good times racing the @world_enduro in our home state of Colorado. | #YetiCycles #SwitchInfinity #SB5C #SB6C | Photo by Seb Schieck
