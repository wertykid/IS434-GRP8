The team @MBRmagazine took the SB150 out for some "relentless beatings" at a race in the Swiss Alps. The outcome was a 10 out of 10 review.
.
“Yeti’s bikes have always looked amazing but the new SB150 is different animal. With 150mm travel on the rear, combined with a 170mm fork and a slack 64.3degree head angle, this modern 29er enduro bike is an absolute weapon on the descents, yet you can still beast everyone on the climbs. The suspension is superbly balanced and the sizing is on point."
