Yeti / @FOX Devo rider, Warren Kniss makes going fast look good. He placed 8th overall at the Big Sky @bigmountainenduro and will be bringing his style and speed to the next race in Winter park. Check out his race rig.

“My bike set up is fairly simple for everything I need it to do. It leans more on the gravity side of things but works extremely well for pedaling and long transfers. People always comment on my bars, but I like them pretty narrow for control, comfort, and to squeeze through trees. I don't change my setup, so I'm always used to it and am never surprised by anything in sketchy situations. I also run my suspension really fast, not totally sure why, but that's how I like it. I use my SB150 for everything because I really believe it's the most versatile bike out there! “ - @warrenkniss
