When the world has collectively slowed down, you don’t slow down. You just get more creative and find lines on the moon.

“With not much going on this summer, we’ve been trying to stay as busy as we can. I called Nic up randomly one afternoon and asked if he wanted to check out this little freeride zone in central Utah. A couple of days later, we found ourselves out there with a couple bikes, cameras, and camping supplies. We hiked a couple of faces before the sun went down, made some questionable food, camped under the stars, and woke up at sunrise to do the same thing before it reached 100 degrees. This place is so fun! Planning on making more trips like this. Freeride or die!”  - @reedboggs
