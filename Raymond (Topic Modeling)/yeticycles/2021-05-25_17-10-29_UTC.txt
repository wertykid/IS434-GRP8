“I don’t want an adventure when I go for a burrito. I want an adventure when I go outside and go somewhere I don’t know. Adventure has been plagiarized to such an extent that it is losing its actual meaning.” - @danmilnerphoto
 
In this episode of TYTM,@martyschaffer talks with world-renowned photo documentarian Dan Milner about the niche he's carved capturing the rich social and cultural journeys that accompany his punishingly long epic rides. Dan has a unique ability to garner amazingly vivid images in an array of consequential environments and self admits to relishing in the pain cave. He’s a prime example of how to immerse yourself in culture and dive headfirst into a new environment.
