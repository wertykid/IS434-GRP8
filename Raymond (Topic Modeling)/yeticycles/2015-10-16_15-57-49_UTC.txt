Sometimes the best moments of a ride are when you take a break, look around, and enjoy the view. Here the Yeti crew takes a break high above Verbier in the Swiss Alps with our two-wheel drifting guide for the day Bart. The view was fleeting as the skies opened up and torrential rains flooded down the peaks into the valley. Unfazed Bart lead team riders Richie and Joey down the slippery trails and into the forest where they played a game of cat and mouse, sliding in out and out of every corner. A day to remember. #YetiCycles
