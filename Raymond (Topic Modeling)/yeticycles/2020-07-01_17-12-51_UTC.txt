If anyone can boost that high charging uphill, it’s Richie Rude.

“Race up, race down. The new @yeticycles SB115 is a blast to ride here in @visitgcb. At 115mm it still gives me the confidence to race down trails like 409.5 and Doctors Park. It’s a pleasure to ride a light, sharp bike up the hills and be rewarded with that same feeling going back down. No compromise here.” - @richie_rude1
