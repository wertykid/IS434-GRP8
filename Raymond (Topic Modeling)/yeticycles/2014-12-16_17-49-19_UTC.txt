Photo of the Day on @pinkbike. We canâ€™t help but look back on the warm days spent riding through wildflowers in the Colorado high country. This photo was taken on the Colorado Trail during the Tribe Gathering in Durango last summer. | #YetiTribe #YetiCycles | Rider: @joeyschusler Photo by: @davetrumporephoto
