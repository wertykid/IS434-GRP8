You know you have mad skills, when @kelleymtb says you have super steezy style. Winner of the round EWS #4 jersey is @curranbrooks. @morse.ah caught this moment as Curran rips through a corner on his Yeti. Thanks for all the great submissions. It was a challenge to choose just one. Next jersey giveaway is next week, following @world_enduro round #5 in Aspen, CO. #YetiCycles #RideDriven
