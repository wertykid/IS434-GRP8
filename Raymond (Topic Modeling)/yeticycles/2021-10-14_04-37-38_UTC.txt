Vision quest inspired. @reedboggs custom painted SB165 is Rampage Ready.

One more day of building and practice until the big event on Friday. 

“The first day of scope day, everyone was running to the left and I was just like, ‘well, I’m going to the right. There’s not much real estate to the left, so I took the lookers right ridge and I have my own line from top to bottom.”

Tune in to @redbull TV to watch it all unfold. Link in bio.
