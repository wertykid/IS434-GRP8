What adventures will 2017 bring? Hopefully more like this, back in August riding the Knik Glacier in Alaska. Not a traditional mountain bike trail, but the idea that nobody had ridden this moraine before inspired @alexstrohl to capture the image. Once up top they were all amazed by the views, a mix of blue, grey and white ice in every direction. Five miles to the west lay the mouth of the glacier, as they pondered the time it would take to travel that distance in these rough conditions the wind picked up. A brisk reminder that is was time to stop gazing and drop in. #YetiCycles #RideDriven
