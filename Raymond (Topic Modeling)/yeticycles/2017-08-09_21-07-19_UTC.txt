Yeti Tribe is never meant to be clean, polished or perfect. In fact, quite the opposite. There are aspects we won’t compromise— a crushing ride aboard the best bikes in the world, good food and drinks, and impeccable company. But you can bet your bottom dollar you won’t find us in a hotel ballroom anytime soon. We embrace the grime and grit.⠀ ⠀
This year’s location, Crested Butte, Colo., is often called the Rocky Mountain home of mountain biking. Many of us remark that the backdrop looks like a movie set - lucky for us it is real. ⠀
