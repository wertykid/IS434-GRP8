Time for a little #FBF to @world_enduro Round 7 in Valberg, France. The terrain at this stop was so varied and unpredictable that it made every moment exciting. @kelleymtb rails a corner keeping it all in one piece. Post a photo of you riding your Yeti on Facebook or Instagram and tag Cody, #YetiCycles and #RaceBred and we'll pick one lucky person at random to win this jersey from Cody's stash. Post by noon (MDT) on Friday, Oct 21. P: @davetrumporephoto
