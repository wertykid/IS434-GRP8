"After our long approach in the cold, we finally reach the plateau 1000 meters above the fjord. The setting is spectacular. The traction on the granite invokes confidence. We find neat little lines, drops, berms, and features all over the place. There is no specific trail to follow, only small piles of rocks to mark the way, but you can ride pretty much anywhere. We let the playful terrain determine our agenda for the day, as there is no rush and detours are welcome." Yeti Ambassador, @mattiasfredrikssonphotography describes the other-worldly riding of Norway. See all of Mattias' photos and read his story from our most recent excursion with fellow ambassador @Joeyschusler Photography and Micke af Ekenstam.
