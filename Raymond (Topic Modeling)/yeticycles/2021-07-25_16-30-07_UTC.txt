We’re halfway through the Big Sky @bigmountainenduro with four stages to go and @richie_rude1 leads the pack by 2.6 seconds.

The Yeti / @FOX Factory Team have four more steep, technical stages to go with only one pedal transfer. “This is the best enduro in the country. There are a lot of steep straights where you can really open her up.” - Rude

Teammates, @shawnneer and @quinnreece sit in 4th and 8th respectively, while @warrenkniss dropped out after the first stage due to a crash. @lauren_bingham_ is in 5th place after day one, ending yesterday on a high note with a second place finish on stage four.

Be sure to follow along today as day two unfolds.
