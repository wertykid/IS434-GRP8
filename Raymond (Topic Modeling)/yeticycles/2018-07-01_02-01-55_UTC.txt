It was a slippery start for the Yeti Fox Factory team at @world_enduro Austria/Slovenia. On Day 1, the team pushed through 50km and three rugged stages. @richie_rude1 sits in the Top 20. Looking forward to a new set of tracks and clearing conditions on Day 2. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
