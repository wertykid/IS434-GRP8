Yeti Ambassador, Max Fierek tested positive for Lyme disease when he was nine years old, since then he has fought fatigue, lung capacity, muscle fatigue, short term memory loss and mood swings. For @mtbfierek, living with Lyme disease for half his life has taught him empathy for others and to cherish his time outside in nature which helps him stay positive and fight for his love of mountain biking.

Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia Burgdorferi. If lyme disease isnâ€™t treated promptly or effectively symptoms can last weeks, months or even years after the tick bite.
