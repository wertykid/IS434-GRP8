The Yeti/Fox Factory Team left their best out on the track today for day one @world_enduro in La Thuile, Italy. After a night of heavy rain and feedback from the pros, race organizers reordered the stages and cut portions of the course, the same is planned for tomorrow. @richie_rude1 ran clean for the first two modified stages, but the third and final stage of the day had other plans. Two hefty crashes on the final run has him sitting in 13th. Teammate @shawnneer is in 29th and @duncan_nason is in 15th for U21. Back at it again tomorrow. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven
