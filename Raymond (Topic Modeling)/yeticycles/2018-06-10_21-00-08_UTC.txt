Rajesh Magar is @rjripper - after winning the Nepal mountain bike national championship three times consecutively, it became clear he is the fastest mountain biker in his country. First learning to ride on a bike he made, RJ made mountain biking his profession as a local guide. Join us on Wednesday, June 20th at Yeti Cycles' headquarters in Golden, CO to see RJ's story come to life thanks to the eye and talent of Yeti ambassador and filmmaker, @joeyschusler. 
The evening will include a happy hour of socializing, a food truck, drinks from @upslope, Joey’s films on the big screen, filmmaker Q&A, and a silent auction with a Yeti Cycles Frame, Fox Shox of your choice, and much more up for grabs. All proceeds will go to support RJ’s race fund and his visa bid to travel to the U.S. Tickets are $12. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #RJRipperFilm
