The places you will go, things you will see, and stories you will have will be unrivaled if the bicycle is your preferred source of transportation through the mountains. Such the case for Yeti Ambassadors @joeyschusler, @samseward & @mason_Lacy who set off for a 12 day self supported ride through the far western reaches of Mongolia in the Altai Mountains. 
Keep an eye out for the full film and @bikemag print feature out soon!
