The location, course and fans in Madeira were regarded as some of the best ever. The racing did not disappoint either as it was a battle of attrition to fight off fatigue and flat tires. Those who did it best sat atop the leader board at the end of day two. @richie_rude1  slapped some turns and sprinted all-out to capture the final two stages, posting a 6th overall for the weekend.
