The majority of the Yeti Fox Team will race tomorrow in Whistler for Round 7 of @world_enduro including @annegalyean. When Anne isn't crunching numbers and playing with beakers in the lab- she holds a PhD in applied chemistry- she's on her bike smashing rocks. Racing starts at 7 am PDT tomorrow, go to EWS website and @pinkbike for live coverage. #YetiCycles #YetiBeti #MoreThanMyth
