The 2014 enduro season opener for myself and fellow Yeti Cycles Ambassador Nate Hills may have been the most demanding, intense, and adventurous event either of us have ever done. We embarked on our journey to South America with the intent to compete in the Andes Pacifico Enduro and then continue on after the event to explore the endless rugged peaks of the Andes. | Check the latest adventures from Yeti Ambassadors @joeyschusler & @natehills as they explore Chile with @smithoptics.
