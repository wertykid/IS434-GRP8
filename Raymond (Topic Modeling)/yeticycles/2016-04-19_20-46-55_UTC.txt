The Yeti SB4.5c takes home one of three Editors' Choice awards from @bicyclingmag. Testers commented that the SB4.5c is "...an efficient climber, but the Switch Infinity suspension allows a tight wheelbase and a springy pop that let's you rail berms, boost airs... and basically forget you're on a short-travel 29er." @bicyclingmag also chose the SB5c and SB5c Beti as stand-outs. Read up on all of it on the @bicyclingmag website now and check it out in print in the July issue. #RideDriven #YetiCycles
