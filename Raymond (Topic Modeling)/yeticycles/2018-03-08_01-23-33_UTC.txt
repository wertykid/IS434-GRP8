We call her Sally Rally, but she wears many hats - coach, pro racer, ambassador, counselor, business owner, leader, mentor, friend. @yetibetisarah came knocking on Yeti's door when she was fresh out of college. We hired her and she's been family since. Check out her write up in @eskapee by @sariebear_ie talking about mountain biking, of course, but touching on some of the more difficult parts of life and loss.
