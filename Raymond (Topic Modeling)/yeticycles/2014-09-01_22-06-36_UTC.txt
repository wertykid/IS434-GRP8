The SB6C was built as a pure enduro machine and proved it's mettle on the EWS circuit. We had the opportunity the past few weeks to whiteness @jaredgravesmtb push the bike's limits off the race track in the Kootenay Range of British Colombia. The results were quite impressive to say the least! | #YetiCycles #SwitchInfinity #SB6C | Photo: @joeyschusler
