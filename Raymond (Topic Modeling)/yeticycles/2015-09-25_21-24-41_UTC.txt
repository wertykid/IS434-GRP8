To celebrate our 30th Anniversary we've kitted out our factory race team in some special one-off throwback jerseys, with the classic Yeti turq and yellow color way. They will be running them for the remaining two EWS rounds. 
We'll also be giving away two of the jerseys, signed by @jaredgravesmtb & @richie_rude1. All you have to do is like this post and tag three friends in the comments below to be entered to win one at random.
