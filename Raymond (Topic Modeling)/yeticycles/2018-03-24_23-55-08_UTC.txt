Conditions in Lo Barnechea, Chile couldn't be more opposite of those for @world_enduro Round 1 in Rotorua, New Zealand last year. Mud and wet roots were traded for the dubious "anti-grip" fine dirt of today's tracks. Loose and wild were the name of the game today. @richie_rude1 came out of the gate swinging for the 2018 season and took the stage wins on 1 and 3, but a crash and flat in stage 2 has Richie sitting in 124th for the day. Three more stages tomorrow. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
