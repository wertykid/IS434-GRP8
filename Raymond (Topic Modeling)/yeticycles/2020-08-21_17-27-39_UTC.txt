Weâ€™re racing now. The Yeti / @FOX Factory team got their first taste at three of eight tracks at the @bigskyresort sky @bigmountainenduro. Even with daily afternoon showers the conditions remain loose and dry. With nearly fully stacked roster, we are out in force and taking runs at close to race pace. Riders were feeling good and enjoying the course, unfortunately @dillon_santos771 suffered a serious training injury and will not be racing this weekend. The team wishes him a speedy recovery and looking forward to his return.

Onward to day two. Keep an eye out as the first race weekend of the year unfolds.
