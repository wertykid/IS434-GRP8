The Yeti Fox Factory Team fought to keep it upright today in Colombia for round 2 of the @World-Enduro. Thanks to a night of torrential rains, the Enduro "Wet" Series was back to haunt the racers. @richie_rude1 commented that he felt like he spent more time with his feet off the pedals than on. Richie held on for a 24th place finish, keeping himself well inside the running for the overall. U21 phenom, @duncan_nason held on to a solid 3rd place finish and maintained 1st in the overall.
