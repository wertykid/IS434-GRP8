The second and last race of the 2020 season is underway. Winter Park was well suited to itâ€™s name - the area was hit by a unexpected storm blanketing the mountain with snow and wind, making riding conditions today extra spicy.

Unfortunately the mixed track conditions got the best of @quinnreece, he will sit out the week due to an injury. The rest of the Yeti / @fox Factory Team is looking forward to a better forecast and primo conditions this weekend 

Stay tuned to see how @bigmountainenduro Winter Park unfolds.
