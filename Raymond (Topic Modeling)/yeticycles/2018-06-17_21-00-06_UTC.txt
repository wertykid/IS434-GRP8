Rajesh Magar learned from a young age that life wasn't always going to be easy. His mom noted that he understood his "circumstances at an early age. So, he started doing little odd jobs and saved up for months to buy a bicycle." That very bicycle was later seen as a distraction and sold, but that still didn't deter RJ. After all, he would come to be known as @rjripper. Nepal's fastest mountain biker, RJ is the subject of @joeyschusler's newest feature #RJRipperFilm. Come see it on the big screen as well as a few other of Joey's edits this Wednesday, June 20th at Yeti Cycles HQ in Golden, CO. All proceeds from ticket sales and silent auction, which includes a Yeti frame and your choice of suspension from Fox, will go towards RJ's visa bid and his plans to race internationally. Link to buy tickets in our bio. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
