A crew of three set out to cover as much downhill ground possible without having much of a solid plan. Transportation hinged on fabled Canadian kindness getting strangers from point A to point B with bikes and gear in tow. “Our trio wasn't trying to prove anything, this carless yet car-dependent exercise-in-exercise wasn't meant to be an altruistic venture to dodge our carbon conscience. If anything, it was a strategic variant on friends' similar trips. They had pedaled every mile of asphalt in between and cherry picked singletrack. In our minds, that sounded like type-two fun. We wanted to use our saddle-sore budget on climbing and descending so we could enjoy the hour-plus descent on Jack The Ripper.

By no means is this an epiphany, it's one of those simple things that is hard to keep in mind. Adventure isn't exclusively hidden beyond the reach of the last cell tower, it's also subtly hidden inside common spaces, where it can be found by choosing a new perspective on the things we think we know.” - Reuben Krabbe
