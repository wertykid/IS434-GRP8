For over a decade, the Yeti Tribe Gathering has become an annual pilgrimage for those who own Yeti mountain bikes. Affectionately known as Yeti freaks, they come from all walks of life and from around the globe to meet each year for epic rides and a weekend of great food, cold beer, and planned stupidity. For our inaugural international Tribe Gathering, we went big and ventured into the high mountains of Nepal, home of the mythical Yeti. #YetiCycles #YetiTribe
