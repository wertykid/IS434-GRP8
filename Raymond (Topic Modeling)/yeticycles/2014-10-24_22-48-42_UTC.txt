As you can see, our friends over at @camp4collective don't always adhere to the norm. They love mountain biking and all things extreme, which can lead to some interesting results when they let the cameras roll. They asked if they could ride the new #SB6C off a cliff and we hesitantly said yes. What we witnessed was a rare moment of complete awe as @slanders_ made the big leap. Check back in the coming weeks for the full video. | #Camp4BeatDown | Photo: @joeyschusler
