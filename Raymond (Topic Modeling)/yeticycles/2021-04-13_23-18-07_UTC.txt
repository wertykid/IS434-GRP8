The path of a Yeti factory supported athlete is tried and true, and proven across disciplines with world titles in DH, 4x, and Enduro. 

Introducing the Yeti / OneUp Pro Team - a freshly minted team comprised of Australian legend, Jared Graves and breakout Squamish native and teammate, Kasper Woolley.

Although the pair are 10,000 miles apart, they’ve been gearing up for a fully booked 2021 race season – Crankworx, EWS, Trans BC, and XCO just to name a few. @jaredgravesmtb and @kasper_woolley will race together for the first time at the first round of the @world_enduro in Italy.

The Yeti / @oneupcomponents Pro Team has the deck stacked with combination of heritage, pedigree, raw talent and skill to an almost unfair degree. The pair is driven and hungry for results. Tune in this season as races are almost underway.
