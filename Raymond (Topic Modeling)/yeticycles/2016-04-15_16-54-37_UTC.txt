The high alpine areas of the Craigieburn region are covered in scrub and beech forests. The treesâ€™ dense thicket of growth provides a canopy creating a wet and muddy playground. Richie and Kelley slid, roosted and bounded there way down playing a bit of cat and mouse. Although the pace was slower than their norm, the technical nature of carrying speed from corner to corner delighted their racer sensibilities. #YetiCycles #ProvenHere #SB55c
