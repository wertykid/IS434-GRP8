Four tracks down, two to go. The terrain at Purgatory is relentless, and it’s not letting up for day two.

Day one held a mix of flow trail and huge drops. After over 14 minutes of racing, @warrenkniss, @quinnreece, and @lauren_bingham_ sit 5th, 10th, and 9th, respectively, in the Pro Men’s and Women’s fields. Stay tuned tomorrow as they take on a 14-mile transfer to the raw backcountry stage, then to the final stage, World Cup.
