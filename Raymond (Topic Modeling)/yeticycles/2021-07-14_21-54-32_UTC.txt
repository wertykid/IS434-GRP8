The Yeti / @FOX Devo Team arrived in Winter Park with high hopes of claiming the National Championship jersey. Unfortunately, that goal was out of reach. @warrenkniss placed 5th, while teammates @lauren_bingham_ and @quinnreece were injured and unable to race.

We're bummed that a scheduling conflict with the @world_enduro meant Rude, and Neer could not make a bid for the sleeve, but thereâ€™s always next year.
