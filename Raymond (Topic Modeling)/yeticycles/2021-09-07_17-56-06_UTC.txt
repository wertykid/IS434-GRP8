After the dust has settled from Loudenvielle, @richie_rude1 now trails Jack Moir for the overall title after a heartbreaking mechanical on Stage Six. With three rounds to go, itâ€™s all to play for. Yeti / @FOX teammate, @shawnneer finished 50th while regaining confidence after a crash while training in Colorado.

Young gun, @kasper_woolley massively stepped up his performance from the first round in Loudenvielle, finishing just off the box at fourth place.

Next up: Crans-Montana for the seventh @world_enduro of the season
