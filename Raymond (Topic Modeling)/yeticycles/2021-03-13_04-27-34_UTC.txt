Time to shake off the nerves - the Yeti / @FOX race team is out in force at @windrockbikepark for the Tennessee National. The weather has held steady all week; then rain rolled in moments before Rude’s seeding run - instantly turning the top layer of dust into clay.

@richie_rude1 exercised caution, accepting an earlier start over the risk that the slick course posed, landing him 14th during seeding.

Following today’s practice, @richie_rude1, @shawnneer, @jubaldavis, @quinnreece, and @warrenkniss will get their final practice day in tomorrow before the three-stage enduro on Sunday.

Stay tuned to see how the boys fare in the Tennessee mud.
