This adventure was something I’d wanted to do for a long time. The goal was to bikepack for 10 days through the San Juans, fishing alpine lakes and streams along the way—and buddies from the Yeti Tribe made the perfect team for it. The San Juans are my backyard—and the ultimate playground for people seeking adventure, solitude, and scintillating singletrack. It was the perfect formula for a mountain biking and fly fishing exploit. @benjamin_kraushaar Yeti Ambassador.
