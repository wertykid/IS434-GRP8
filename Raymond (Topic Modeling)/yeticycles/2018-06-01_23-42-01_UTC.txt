Yeti Ambassador, @thatslavintho takes flight on the SB100 Beti on her home trails in New England. Check in with us over the next week as we highlight all the different ways our ambassadors spec this capable beast of a bike. Laura switches between a Fox Float 32 Stepcast 100 mm fork, for more XC oriented days, and a Fox Performance Elite 130 mm on sendy days. #YetiCycles #YetiBeti #RideDriven #RaceBred P: @nobreakschris
