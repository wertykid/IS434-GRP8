@joeyschusler isn’t the type of person who can sit still for very long. He’s raced World Cup downhills and podiumed at enduro races but, for him, sharing stories of adventure through his award winning films is what really drives him. For Joey, nothing beats setting off into the unknown with just his bike, some camera equipment and the bare essentials. Prepare to be inspired in episode 3 of Talk Yeti To Me. Link in bio.
