On this episode of Talk Yeti To Me, @megan.j.rose and @martyschaffer talk about what it really takes to put on races like these, why free beer is a must at the finish line and how the communities Megan works with helps create long lasting friendships and some of the most epic days of riding for those willing enough to attend.
