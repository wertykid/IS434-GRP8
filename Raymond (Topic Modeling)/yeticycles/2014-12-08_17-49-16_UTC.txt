This scene is almost certainly covered under multiple feet of snow by now, but just a few weeks ago it was in it’s peak season for mountain biking. We can’t help and look back at what a fun time we had riding in the Elk Mountains this past fall. If you missed the full video with Yeti Ambassadors @michael_hlarsen, @shawnneer, and Rudy Unrau shredding some of our favorite trails, you can see it via the link in our profile. | #YetiTribe #YetiFallGathering #MTB #ElkMountains #CrestedButte #ColoradoFall | Photo by: @joeyschusler
