Racers are on course in Olargues, France for the third round of the @world_enduro series. @richie_rude1 is off to a solid start taking the win on stage 1. The next two days of racing will cover 81 km of rocky, technical, tight trails with plenty of "French lines." We'll post end of day results here and check out the EWS live feed online for stage updates.  #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth P: @davetrumporephoto
