@yeticycles ambassador @joeyschusler seems to always be on an adventure or planning one. Once a factory race team athlete, planning is in Joey’s DNA. He attended his own school of hard knocks and every trip offers its own lessons and successes. Here is Joey’s advice to anyone taking on their first bike adventure: “The first and most important step is to commit 100% to going. Make the time, pick the route, and go. Finding a good route can be challenging, but scouring blogs, picking friends brains, searching maps, and obsessing over Google Earth until you find the route you are looking for usually does the trick. There are trails everywhere, and some great resources online for planning.”

“The next step is to figure out what gear is best for you, and best for the adventure at hand. Asking the right questions helps to dial in your adventure and make sure you are prepared. Will you be camping? Will it be cold? Hot? What are your water sources? Are these good sources? Are there any huts or towns along the way? How many days do you want to go for? How much food will you need? What gear can you bail on?”

“Ask yourself any and all questions you can muster, and hopefully you’ll be prepared enough. The best way to figure out your adventure planning though is previous experience. Every trip and adventure you go on, learn from it, figure out what worked best, and build off that on your next adventure. That’s really the best way to dial things in.” #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
