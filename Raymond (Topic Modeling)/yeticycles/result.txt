Sad to see Eliot Jackson leave MTB racing behind. He was a fantastic person to have on the team and I'm sure the entire MTB industry will miss that one of a kind, unmistakeable moto style. Thanks for everything Eliot! #eliotjackson #bestwhipsever #mountainbike #yeticycles #greenriver

Don't let the nimble feel and low-weight of this new Yeti carbon rig fool you. The frame boasts 29 inch wheels and a 5 inch chassis capable of rolling over the roughest rocks on the trail. Mike West, Horsetheif Bench trail, Fruita, Co. #yeticycles #SB95C

We had a total blast riding, hanging, chatting, and general fun having with everyone this weekend. Thanks to all who came out to join us. 12th annual #YetiCycles #YetiTribe gathering in the books.
Early morning on the #YetiTribe group ride. Who all enjoyed #Telluride this weekend? What a place.
A land largely unaffected by the progress of man, the Tetons Range and the surrounding areas are a pristine ecosystem inhabited by a vast diversity of wildlife spreading across multiple national parks. Uninhibited by foothills on the eastern side the range rises sharply and splits upper Wyoming and lower Idaho in two. On one side sits Jackson Hole, home to the legendary ski area and playground to outdoor junkies. On the other resides the Teton Valley: a landscape dotted with hay farms and the small rustic towns of eastern Idaho. Smack in the middle, off the pass that separates the two, lies some of the most progressive mountain bike trails in America. Local riders teaming with the Forest Service have created a network of trails designed and built specifically for riding. We explored both sides of the pass and rode varied terrain from purpose-built bike park features to backcountry singletrack, clinging to the edge of 10,000-foot peaks. The experience instilled a sense in us that the locals have got it figured out here… and the need for a satellite Yeti office in JH. #ProvenHere #Tetons video online now at YetiCycles.com

The 2014 lineup has arrived.  At the forefront is the new SB75. It's a five inch bike built on our Switch Technology platform, packaged in a 27.5" wheel size.  For 2014 we will also be offering a fully redesigned 27.5" wheeled 575, the SB66 and SB95 in a more affordable Comp kit, and the new upgraded alloy SB66 and SB95 with carbon rear end at no extra cost. | #YetiCycles #Yeti575 #SB66 #SB95 #SB75

There is a reason why we love having the @yeticycles factory here in Colorado. On the same day you can rip tacky dirt down in the foothills, and ski soft powder up in the high peaks.

Windproof, comfortable, cut for bike use, and the list goes on…all the reasons why the Smuggler Hoody is the perfect, all-around piece for cool days. While it has great performance to warrant cold weather use on your ride, it still has a casual look that begs to worn with flip flops, not just SPDs. | #ProvenHere #Fruita #YetiCycles #SB95C
The Yeti Tribe is a diverse group that shares our same devotion to owning and riding great bikes. Liz joined the tribe at the start of last summer when she got her first Yeti. Riding at any chance she could, her skills have improved incredibly in just a few short months. More importantly, she has learned how to have an incredible amount of fun on her bike each and every time she hits the trail. | #YetiCycles #SB66C #YetiTribe @long_live_lemon
Don't call us between 11:30 and 1:00. We won't be here. Every day, weather permitting, we shut our doors, turn on the answering machine and head out for a ride at lunch. With the headquarters situated at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, our local trails are just a few pedal stokes away. This daily opportunity to get out and ride is a large part of why many started working here, but at the same time, it allows us to test and refine new models, try out component spec, or just drop the boss on a climb. It is core to the process behind the bikes we design and manufacture.

From buff singletrack to loose technical terrain, the high desert trails of Fruita run the gamut. Mike West embraces the versatility of the SB95 Carbon on Horsethief Bench.

Build it up light with the XO1 kit (25.7 lbs) or a bit more stout with our XT kit (27.8 lbs) all for the same complete bike price. The flexibility for whatever your riding needs are.

Yeti Ambassadors @natehills1 & @joeyschusler have been in Chile the last week racing the rough and rugged 4 day @montenbaik Andes Pacifico Enduro race. Expect to see more stories from the trip soon. | #YetiCycles #SB66C #AndesPacifico #AntiGrip
Since it release the SB95 Carbon has proven itself to be one of the most versatile 29er bikes, capable of handling the technical descents while maximizing efficiency on the uphill via the “Switch Tech” rear-travel system.

"Jared Graves is definitely not a man to piss around. Robust application of brain and brawn, carried out quietly without a fuss... His endeavors in last season's Enduro World Series have been singularly on the lash... Big style.

The 2014 enduro season opener for myself and fellow Yeti Cycles Ambassador Nate Hills may have been the most demanding, intense, and adventurous event either of us have ever done. We embarked on our journey to South America with the intent to compete in the Andes Pacifico Enduro and then continue on after the event to explore the endless rugged peaks of the Andes. | Check the latest adventures from Yeti Ambassadors @joeyschusler & @natehills as they explore Chile with @smithoptics.

When we first started planning our weeklong backcountry bike-packing trip to Peru, bringing the newly redesigned Yeti 575 was the natural choice. The adventure would be self supported in some of the most rugged mountains in the world, the Huayhuash Range tucked high up in the Peruvian Andes, and what we needed most in a bike was reliability. With a simplistic design and a durable aluminum chassis, the 575 held up to the test as we managed to navigate the demanding terrain without a single mechanical. What the bike lacks in high-tech features and carbon fiber proved to be its greatest assets. Stay tuned to see the entire photo feature and film from @joeyschusler & @thomaswoodson dropping online at the end of April. | #YetiCycles #Yeti575
Road trip!!! Over the next few weeks we will be exploring the southwest in search of warmer weather and dusty trails. Moab, Sedona, and everything in between never disappoints. | #YetiCycles #ProvenHere
The southwest seems to have endless vistas and endless trails. The view from the top of "Captain Ahab" in Moab doesn't disappoint. | Photo from our #ProvenHere Southwest trip.

While it can double-time for a casual vacation, the Pandora Duffle was designed with the Mountain bike at the center of it's attention. | #YetiCycles
This weekend marks the first round of the 2014 @world_enduro. Last season @jaredgravesmtb placed second overall. You can bet that he won't settle for anything but that top spot this time around. Let's go racing! | #YetiCycles
A solid start to the long season ahead for the Yeti race team. @jaredgravesmtb was on the attack all week at @world_enduro Round One in Chile. He ended up second place overall, hot on the heels of Jerome Clementz. | #YetiCycles
This past January, Yeti Cycles ambassadors @joeyschusler, @thomaswoodson, and @samwseward ventured to the remote Huayhuash range in the Peruvian Andes in search of an epic ride. What they found far surpassed their expectations. Follow along this week as we share images from their adventure and stay tuned for the short film and multimedia feature launching on @bikemag next Monday. | #YetiCycles #HuayhuashFilm
Current Junior Downhill World Champion @richie_rude1 had never raced a big enduro event before this past weekends @world_enduro in Chile. While he didn’t get the exact result he was gunning for, he still had quite a respectable showing for being the new kid on the block. Look for Richie to be climbing the ranks throughout the season. The kid is a powerhouse on the bike. | #YetiCycles #SB66C
The beauty seen riding in the Cordillera Huayhuash is unrivaled. The extreme elevation of the trail (almost all above 14,000ft) and remote nature of the zone make it a difficult place to get to, but it's almost always worth it. Yeti ambassadors @joeyschusler, @samwseward, and @thomaswoodson went fully self supported on this loop for 8 days. Be sure to check out the @bikemag short film and multimedia feature launching Monday, April 28th. | #YetiCycles #Yeti575 #HuayhuashFilm

Each trail the team rode seemed to get better than the last as they twisted and turned, almost effortlessly, though the forest and into the valley below. | #YetiCycles | Photo by @davetrumporephoto
It's safe to say that @richie_rude1 and @jaredgravesmtb made the most of their trip to Chile.

Spring is here which means it’s now officially time to hit the trails. The SB75 is a great all around trail bike perfect for those drawn to epic weekend rides or just a quick early morning loop before work. Check out a #SB75 for yourself at your local Yeti dealer. | #YetiCycles | Photo by @davetrumporephoto
Aluminum in the front, carbon in the rear. The SB95 comes in at just a half pound heavier than the full carbon SB95C version, at a price that is much more affordable. The carbon rear end, now standard, increases the stiffness while giving the bike a much more lively ride. Top that with great availability and the new SB95 is a no brainer for your new summer ride. Check one out today at your local Yeti dealer. | Yeti Ambassador @lydlovesmud ripping on the Colorado Trail earlier this week. | #YetiCycles #SB95
Racing doesn't always go quite as planned and even the best have tough days now and then. A rough start to the Soctland @world_enduro leaves @jaredgravesmtb hungry for more on the race track tomorrow. | #YetiCycles
@jaredgravesmtb had a solid second day of racing at the Scotland round of the @world_enduro. He clawed his way to 8th place overall after sitting way back in 30th after day one, and topped off the weekend with taking a stage win on the very last stage. | #YetiCycles
Results from day one at round three of the @world_enduro in France are in. After a few mishaps @jaredgravesmtb sits in third overall. Young @richie_rude1 showed some incredible speed today taking third in stage two. | #YetiCycles

We headed to the high desert trails of the southwest US last spring to test out the new ASR Carbon. Designed as a cross-country race machine we found it had an enduro alter-ego. It had no problems picking its way down the backside of Amasa Back in Moab.

For the past few weeks we've been chasing pristine alpine singletrack and fast loamy trail with @jaredgravesmtb here in the Kootenay mountains of BC. Even Jared will agree that it's nice to take a step back from racing after a long season and just enjoy the ride. | #YetiCycles #ProvenHere #SwitchInfinity #SB6C | Photo by @joeyschusler
@jaredgravesmtb claims these trails in BC are some of the best he's ever ridden. Not a bad place then to shoot a video of him pushing the limits of his new #SwitchInfinity equipped #SB6C | #YetiCycles #ProvenHere
The SB6C was built as a pure enduro machine and proved it's mettle on the EWS circuit. We had the opportunity the past few weeks to whiteness @jaredgravesmtb push the bike's limits off the race track in the Kootenay Range of British Colombia. The results were quite impressive to say the least! | #YetiCycles #SwitchInfinity #SB6C | Photo: @joeyschusler

@justin_reiter recounts his experience on the 500 mile Colorado Trail thru-ride that he completed last summer with some fellow Yeti Ambassadors, "The days and miles passed. Some slower than others.

Sometimes the most challenging and arduous adventure is the one right in your own backyard. The Colorado Trail links up the states largest metropolitan region with some of the best mountain bike trails in the country, spanning over 500 miles through the rugged and scenic alpine wilderness from Denver to Durango. This past summer a group of Colorado based Yeti Ambassadors set out to give it a go for themselves. | See the entire story and video, online now via the link in our profile. | @justin_reiter @craigjones250 @sam_seward @joeyschusler | #YetiTribe #ColoradoTrail #ARCc #ASRc

Riding in the fall is one of our favorite pastimes.

There is a small window in the Colorado high country when the trail conditions are perfect. Some would call it fall, but nature is fickle here -- often the warm days of summer push up against the sting of winter. In the high country, cold winds blow and snow dusts the peaks. Lower in the valley, aspens drop their leaves and cover the trails in a vibrant carpet of red, gold, and orange. Motivated by the oncoming threat of winter and the desire for one last chance to ride the state's best single track, Yeti Ambassadors @michael_hlarsen, @shawnneer, @piphunt, and Rudy Unrau hit the road to enjoy Colorado's peak season. | Link to full video in profile. | #YetiTribe #YetiFallGathering #ElkMountains #CrestedButte #SwitchInfinity #SB6c #SB5c | Photo by: @joeyschusler

We only got to scratch the surface of the trails at Izoard, trails that on the map run out in every direction for tens of miles. For me as the photographer, the bad weather actually served up a lot more atmosphere than we'd have had with sunshine, really helping pick out the rock formations. For Jared and Richie, they got to throw the bikes around on some very loose corners that felt more like the Dolomites than the Alps. | #YetiCycles #SwitchInfinity #SB5c | Riders: @jaredgravesmtb & @richie_rude1 Photo: Dan Milner
What do you do with two riders fresh from the Valloire EWS stage? Send them to nearby La Grave for a week with photographer Dan Milner to juggle training programs, massive calorific intakes and nailing images aboard their new SB5c bikes. Coming straight from the chaos, intensity and race win at Valloire, spending a week in the little village of La Grave was like stepping into another world. | #SB5c #SwitchInfinity #RideDriven | Riders: @jaredgravesmtb & @richie_rude1 Photo: Dan Milner | View the full photo story now over on @pinkbike or via the link in our profile.

La Grave is not known as a mountain bike Mecca. It's steep and unforgiving. In the winter it's two curious lifts hurl backcountry skiers straight into 10,000ft off-piste descents that dodge glacial crevasses and seracs. In summer, its five dedicated trails carry a similar feel: committing. But, just outside the resort, we found trails that oozed flow like an over-ripe Brie. | #YetiCycles #SwitchInfinity #SB5c | Riders: @jaredgravesmtb & @richie_rude1 Photo: Dan Milner
The official bike trails at La Grave have consistency. Beginning above tree line they are steep, rocky and technical. Once in the trees, they are steep, rooty and technical. It was a great proving ground for the SB5c's ride-anything capabilities. | #SwitchInfinity #SB5c #YetiCycles | Riders: @jaredgravesmtb & @richie_rude1 Photo: Dan Milner

The SB6c is full of surprises.

Dropping in on the steeps. | After a long winter with minimal riding in the schedule, we headed out to Green River, Utah to recharge the batteries and spend some quality time with the SB6c. | #SwitchInfinity #SB6c #YetiCycles #RideDriven | Rider: @shawnneer Photo by: @joeyschusler
Green River, Utah has become well known over the years as one of the most iconic freeride mountain biking locations. Towering book cliffs, soft dirt, and complex terrain make for some of the most unique riding on earth. And while a full on DH rig is typically the bike of choice for such burly terrain, we had different plans. We hit the road to Green River with Yeti Ambassador and local Colorado shredder @shawnneer. Our plan was to tackle the large lines seen in the magazines and movies on a Yeti SB6c trail bike. Upon arrival, a hillside with endless possibilities lay before us. Before we knew it we had found our groove for the week; building lines, riding at the edge of our limits, and enjoying the quaint and laid back atmosphere of Green River. It was a much welcomed week of excitement in the midst of the cold Colorado winter months. | #SB6c #SwitchInfinity #YetiCycles #RideDriven | Rider: @shawnneer Photo by: @joeyschusler

The Caucasus Mountains are the real deal. They are known as Europe’s highest peaks, towering in altitude above the Alps. This rugged range is located on the border with Georgia and Russia, at the nexus of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The region has a rich and troubled history, filled with violence, war, and hardship. We found nothing but gorgeous and vast empty landscapes; It’s hard to image this place as anything but peaceful and serene.

When riding in the backcountry, the best descents and most rewarding moments don’t come easy. We slogged on for hours and hours, but all the suffering was soon forgotten as we found ourselves perched on top of over 100 switchbacks and 4,000 vertical feet of prime single track to descend to the valley floor below.

For over a decade, the Yeti Tribe Gathering has become an annual pilgrimage for those who own Yeti mountain bikes. Affectionately known as Yeti freaks, they come from all walks of life and from around the globe to meet each year for epic rides and a weekend of great food, cold beer, and planned stupidity. For our inaugural international Tribe Gathering, we went big and ventured into the high mountains of Nepal, home of the mythical Yeti. #YetiCycles #YetiTribe

The Yeti/Fox Racing team gets a shot of new blood this year with the high style and gravity expertise of Cody Kelley (@kelleymtb) winner of the 2014 Dual Slalom at Sea Otter. Kelley comes under the wing of 2016’s team leader and Enduro World Series (EWS) Champion Richie Rude, a five-year Yeti veteran racer who came on board at the age of 16 before taking the 2013 Junior DH World Champion title. Despite his young age, Rude’s experience and two world championships will prove valuable as the team continues to focus on enduro. #YetiCycles

"Nepal isn’t easy to get to and that’s part of the adventure. Fortunately, I would be met on the other end by the crew from H&I Adventures — all Yeti freaks and the world’s best mountain bike travel company. I would also be greeted by twenty-five Yeti riders, affectionately called the tribe, who had traveled from the US, UK, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Indonesia. It was truly humbling to spend our 30th Anniversary in Nepal with this diverse group of Yeti owners — I was incredibly stoked." Link in our profile to Nepal excursion.

As a mountain biker, there are moments that you don’t soon forget. It was the last day of our trip to Iceland riding and testing the SB4.5c and we were met with a cold rainy morning. Motivation was beginning to fizzle. We waited out the storm and as it subsided we were left with tacky trails, brisk air, and nothing but muddy grins on our faces as we made our way down the winding trail parallel to countless waterfalls, ending at the famed Skógafoss. A perfect ride to end yet another grand adventure on two wheels. #YetiCycles #ProvenHere #SB45c

Southwest. Proven Here.

The landscape of the American southwest is an ethereal place. The cathedral towers, deep canyons, and crushed red dirt produce terrain with endless riding possibilities. One is only limited by his efforts to push further. Pedaling along the sun drenched plateaus and in the shadowed canyons, all while sleeping below the stars in the cool night, you can start to feel displaced from the daily grind. That is until the beer runs low, the skins begins to redden and you head back to civilization to refuel. The deserts of the southwest are like a second home for many mountain bikers, providing a sanctuary in the winter months as an escape from whatever ails.

No matter where you started, from Burro Pass in the high elevations to the lower rim, it all ends here, spitting you out along miles of singletrack adjacent to the mighty Colorado River.

From the tangled sheep paths of the tussock grasslands to purpose-built trails snaking through the sharp mountain peaks, New Zealand ’s varied topography makes for an awe-inspiring mountain bike playground. We traveled throughout the South Island testing the SB5.5c on the fast, ragged conditions in Queenstown and Mount Cook to the mud and gnarled roots of the beach forests of Craigieburn. #YetiCycles #ProvenHere

Link in bio for full video.
Queenstown is the social and adventure hub of the south island. From grabbing lunch and chatting up the line, at the iconic Fergburger to swinging a few thousand feet off the ground on a bungy, it has it all covered. Littered throughout the hills above Queenstown in the Cornet and Moonlight peaks are trails, trails that make for exceptional riding.

The iconic Mt Cook is New Zealand's highest peak, knows as Aoraki to the native Maori people. While the destination is primarily known by adventure seekers for rock climbing, the steep paths hidden among the tussock grass provide for some untamed and challenging downhills runs. The hike back up the pitches forces one to take pause at the top, sometimes to catch your breath, but more so to enjoy the view after each successive ride down.

The high alpine areas of the Craigieburn region are covered in scrub and beech forests. The trees’ dense thicket of growth provides a canopy creating a wet and muddy playground. Richie and Kelley slid, roosted and bounded there way down playing a bit of cat and mouse.

The Yeti SB4.5c takes home one of three Editors' Choice awards from @bicyclingmag. Testers commented that the SB4.5c is "...an efficient climber, but the Switch Infinity suspension allows a tight wheelbase and a springy pop that let's you rail berms, boost airs... and basically forget you're on a short-travel 29er." @bicyclingmag also chose the SB5c and SB5c Beti as stand-outs. Read up on all of it on the @bicyclingmag website now and check it out in print in the July issue. #RideDriven #YetiCycles
Our trip to New Zealand was all about exploring the shear scope of the landscape and the fantastic riding it offers. With a small population and virtually no trail access issues, the riding is almost limitless. We imagine like it was 50 years ago in the U.S. We all agreed, the laid back NZ lifestyle grew on us. #YetiCycles #ProvenHere

Link to film in profile! - Three Yeti ambassadors and childhood friends @joeyschusler, @sam_seward, and @mason_lacy set out for the far western corner of Mongolia to combine mountain biking and packrafting in a self-supported adventure into the unknown. Aboard the #SB5c and the #SB45c, this would be their first attempt at a mountain bike to packraft link-up in one of the most remote and sparsely populated places in the world. Told in detail in the upcoming July issue of @bikemag, the adventure that ensued pushed the boundaries of comfort, but also of what they knew of human generosity, camaraderie and the spirit of adventure that connects us all. #FlashesOfTheAltai #YetiTribe
"The Kazakh nomads of Western Mongolia, move from place to place as the seasons, farming and hunting determine. They live in what we would call yurts - in their language "Gers" and they move them piece by piece, tapestry by tapestry on their horses and camels. As we rode by, locals would often invite us in, proud to show us their homes and share local delicacies like fermented mare's milk served along side stale sweets. We sat with the elders, ate and communicated as best we could. Of course, the kids would ride our bikes around outside and marvel at parts and components that looked so foreign to them. When we rode away, our lives stuffed into bikepacking bags it was clear to us how a simpler life can often bring the most happiness." - Yeti Ambassador @joeyschusler from #FlashesOfTheAltai, link to film in profile.

While the SB5.5c may have been born from racing, it’s reliability and performance transferred right over to this style of bikepacking adventure. Coupled with some Revelate Designs bikepacking bags, ENVE wheels, and fresh off the press SRAM Eagle drivetrain we were fully kitted to go light and fast to the best of our abilities.  Throughout the entire 11 days we were lucky enough to only experience one mechanical, an easy fix, a flat tire. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #SB55
What adventures will 2017 bring? Hopefully more like this, back in August riding the Knik Glacier in Alaska. Not a traditional mountain bike trail, but the idea that nobody had ridden this moraine before inspired @alexstrohl to capture the image. Once up top they were all amazed by the views, a mix of blue, grey and white ice in every direction. Five miles to the west lay the mouth of the glacier, as they pondered the time it would take to travel that distance in these rough conditions the wind picked up. A brisk reminder that is was time to stop gazing and drop in. #YetiCycles #RideDriven

High Altitude Lines. A Yeti Tribe Story. For full video click link in bio. #YetiTribe #MoreThanMyth⠀⠀
⠀⠀
This adventure was something I’d wanted to do for a long time. The goal was to bikepack for 10 days through the San Juans, fishing alpine lakes and streams along the way—and buddies from the Yeti Tribe made the perfect team for it. The San Juans are my backyard—and the ultimate playground for people seeking adventure, solitude, and scintillating singletrack. It was the perfect formula for a mountain biking and fly fishing exploit. @benjamin_kraushaar Yeti Ambassador.
The hills were steep, the rain relentless, and hike-a-bikes grueling. It was as if the mountains didn't want us there. With every labored pedal stroke forward, Mother Nature seemingly fought backward with equal might. For almost the whole trip, the weather was especially bad. Instead of Colorado’s typical powerful but short storms, we got pounded with chronic bad weather. For more on the High Altitude Lines excursion click link in bio. #YetiTribe #MoreThanMyth ⠀

We finally caught a break in the weather and made an early morning attempt at an unnamed, 13,000-foot pass that would eventually leads us to Silverton. There is something about predawn alpine starts that seems to intensify the sense of adventure. Maybe it's the cool air, or the rough transition from deep sleep to mouth breathing exertion. #YetiTribe #MoreThanMyth ⠀

I’m a big fan of tent chilling, but being cooped up with Sam for hours on end when I could be fishing a beautiful alpine lake, is a tough pill to swallow.

Both mountain biking and fly fishing ignite emotions of triumph and dismay. The frustration of fixing a flat in the rain closely parallels the feeling of untangling a line snagged in a tree.

Rain has become a staple on the EWS circuit this year and when racers awoke on Saturday morning to see the skies had opened up and mud and puddles riddled the pits, it seemed Mother Nature has dealt another interesting hand. Colorado dirt however, had other plans and while the early starters wrestled with slick conditions, the tracks had dried before the pros toed the line. With weeks of elevation prep under his belt and a hunger for a win, @richie_rude1 won the day despite crashes on stage 2 and 3. Tracks are dry for Sunday and stages 4-6 hold a few more technical challenges than what riders saw in the first three stages. With a 10-second lead, Richie is focused on taking it all the way home.

There are aspects we won’t compromise— a crushing ride aboard the best bikes in the world, good food and drinks, and impeccable company. But you can bet your bottom dollar you won’t find us in a hotel ballroom anytime soon. We embrace the grime and grit.⠀ ⠀
This year’s location, Crested Butte, Colo., is often called the Rocky Mountain home of mountain biking. Many of us remark that the backdrop looks like a movie set - lucky for us it is real. ⠀

It's dry, dusty and smoky for @world_enduro Round 7 in Whistler, Canada. Highly unusual for this normally loamy track. We can't help but to crack smiles when we see the forecast for rain over the weekend. What has been a bit of a curse for EWS this season, may bring much needed traction back to @richie_rude1 favorite run - Top of the World. Stay tuned. #YetiCycles #MoreThanMyth #RideDriven P: @davetrumporephoto

Some races feel less like a competition between riders and more like a competition between rider and trail. Such was the case for the Yeti Fox Factory Team over the weekend @world_enduro round 7 in Whistler. This year the race kicked off with the storied and highly technical Top of the World trail. Just over 7 km later, three of the seven Yeti riders had succumb to mechanicals or gnarly stack ups leaving either their bodies or bikes useless. Athletes @richie_rude1, @shawnneer in the pro-men category and @duncan_nason and @paulserra2204 in U21, would muster the strength and focus to charge on. Richie struggled to find his rhythm all day but by stages 4 and 5 it finally clicked. He took 3rd and 1st respectively. It wasn't, enough, however, to win the day and Richie ended up 12th.

With a newfound sense of motivation and energy, we dropped into what would be the most glorious section of trail on the trip. Our bikes bounced over loose volcanic rock, and our tires dug deep into the tacky soil. We blazed through a blur of wildflowers and sub alpine fir. With a little help from gravity, we eventually made our way into the historic mining town of Silverton. - @benjamin_kraushaar ⠀

Last year, when we designed the SB5 with all-new geometry and design – we all thought it looked a lot like the old chum we knew and loved. When we got aboard this capable trail bike in Whitefish, Montana we were suddenly clearing technical climbs with far less effort and our descents were more playful and speedy than before. It’s tough to make a great thing better, but we feel confident we got it right. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth⠀

For @sarahvirginiauhl a freelance fine art and commercial artist, her work—and her play— stem from flow. It’s why her mountain biking and her painting go hand in hand. And why, when she packs for a road trip, she always throws in both her Yeti Beti and art supplies. From Carbondale, Colo., where Sarah lives, Crested Butte is the perfect getaway: a mere scenic three-hour drive away, buff singletrack, ample campsites, and arguably the densest stands of aspens in the state. ⠀⠀⠀⠀

Let this sink in, the SB6 has more stage, race and overall wins, including back-to-back EWS World Championships, than any other bike on the Enduro World Series circuit. Racing is our legacy, heritage and the cornerstone of what we do. We race to win. The limited edition SB6TR is your chance to ride the same bike as two-time EWS Champ Richie Rude. Hung with the best parts from longtime Factory Team sponsors like Fox, Shimano, DT Swiss, Renthal, Chris King, Maxxis, One-Up and Ergon this bike pulverizes EWS race tracks around the world and put our athletes atop podiums. Check it out on the Yeti website this week when new bikes drop. ⠀

The best way to describe Yeti’s design philosophy is with a quick view into our product meetings. Recently, we debated gear ratios and what front chainring size we should model our kinematics around. Scenarios were laid out from all angles. Climbing, descending, Apex, Nor Cal, Whistler and racing. It was spirited and took the better part of the afternoon.⠀ ⠀
Some would say we dive too deep into the minutia, but this is the ethos of Yeti. It isn’t a battle of egos. It’s about making sure we make the best riding mountain bikes. We have the luxury of making product decisions in a vacuum – no bean counters looking over our shoulders, no focus groups and nobody to answer to except the Tribe.⠀ ⠀
Once the decision is made, there is no second guessing. We easily move on with the comfort knowing that the collective scrutiny produced the right direction.⠀ ⠀
The 2018 bike line is not the result of a one or two-year development project. It is born from years of making tough product decisions. Chris and I know that perfection will forever be a moving target, yet we will always strive for it. We’re excited to present the new product line. Hope you enjoy it.⠀ ⠀

Squamish-Whistler-Pemberton-Abbotsford-Vancouver-Squamish – this would be our planned route. A mixture of singletrack, brutal climbs, fire road and hitchhiking. We assembled our usual motley crew Yeti Ambassadors @rossmeasures and myself @reubenkrabbe, and our buddy @tobinseagel - with the objective of riding as much singletrack we could find. We knew avoiding all the asphalt would be impossible, but we are also keenly familiar with the hospitality of Canadians and placed a heavy bet. -Reuben Krabbe, Yeti ambassador and photographer takes on a hitching and riding adventure with buddies.

The smart car pulls away, Ross doubles over in laughter having thought the humble clown car was trying to offer a ride to three hitchhiking mountain bikers. To be fair, Ross had been splayed out on a concrete barrier looking like he was injured or the victim of a roadside exorcism. Bike upturned beside him, his posture of complete exhaustion would prove to be prophetic over the next five days, where we hoped for our thumbs to act as bus fare on a 500KM loop of the Southern Coast Range of BC.⠀

@richie_rude1 gets some practice time between the tape for the final stop of the @world_enduro series in Finale Ligure, Italy. The riding in Finale is hard to describe. The trails in the lower foothills are loose, rocky and exposed. Up high it is equally rocky, but some trails offer more traction, the corners are tight and there are plenty of trees that can grab handlebars. Overall, the riding is technical, challenging and unpredictable. The outcome is the appropriate setting to put the world's best riders to the ultimate and final test. Racing starts Saturday. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth⠀

A paved road leads up Cypress mountain. A meniscus crushing, dehydration inducing, serpentine path of suffering that's well traveled by lycra wearing chumps, and tourist vehicles trying to gain perspective on the metropolis of Vancouver. It could be pedaled, but we could also ride the coattails of some unsuspecting tourist, so we wait instead. A sloth paced RV pulls into view, an awkwardly long amount of time passes as we look into the RV's windshield as it inches towards us up the hill. It stops, and moments later three bikes are getting crammed into the RV's walkway. Every pickup so far have been from Quebecois drivers. For some reason, they’ve been our saviors. I'm trying to make small talk with the family's two French speaking children, while Tobin banters away with the driving parents.⠀

Richie Rude won’t tell you many details about his run that locked down the Junior World Championship DH title for him in 2013. Or how he comes back from flats or mechanicals on the most challenging enduro tracks in the world to win stages - seemingly out of nowhere. And he isn’t one to boast about back-to-back EWS World Championships. When you ask him how he rides at such daunting speeds with undebatable skill, it’s usually in five words or less and accompanied by an unassuming shoulder shrug. @richie_rude1 is the Silent Shredder. ⠀

"In northern New England when the days grow shorter and the air begins to cool, nature reveals one of its awe-inspiring spectacles. The leaves of the deciduous forests transform from summer green to a kaleidoscope of colors. The moment is fleeting as the leaves accumulate covering up the trails and signal the inevitable arrival of winter.

Cochran's ski hill is not only a mountain famous for the Olympic skiers from which it gets its namesake, but also for being the source of one of Vermont's other famous exports - maple syrup. Throughout the fall, riders wind their way up and down the hills below a canopy of colorful leaves and a spiderweb of pale blue sap lines. With it taking nearly ten gallons of sap to yield just one quart of sweet golden syrup, you can bet those lines are flowing just as fast as the wheels below. ⠀

When two like-minded companies @yeticycles and @opencycle share the same design philosophy – “building bikes we want to ride” Great things happen. Today, we are launching the all-new Yeti-inspired NEW U.P. frameset in iconic Yeti turquoise. The NEW U.P., for Unbeaten Path, is an all-carbon frame that combines the geometry of a road-riding position with the clearance for cross and mountain bike tires – up to 27.5 x 2.1 inches. The outcome is a bike capable of taking on asphalt, gravel roads or singletrack. Available at Open dealers and online. Check out the link in our bio.

Congratulations to Yeti Cycles Ambassador, guide, and three-time Nepali National MTB Champion @rjripper for being nominated as a @natgeo "Adventurer of the Year." Known as RJ Ripper to his friends and Yeti family, he first raced his country's national championship on a "franken-bike" he fabricated from old bike and motorcycle parts. He later caught the eye of a local bike racer, guide company owner, and distributor, @mandilpradhan. Mandil took RJ under his wing and along with help from the global mountain bike community and RJ's family, RJ became one of the fastest mountain bikers in Asia.

Thanks to a night of torrential rains, the Enduro "Wet" Series was back to haunt the racers. @richie_rude1 commented that he felt like he spent more time with his feet off the pedals than on. Richie held on for a 24th place finish, keeping himself well inside the running for the overall. U21 phenom, @duncan_nason held on to a solid 3rd place finish and maintained 1st in the overall.

"The allure of loam and steep descents up north are what keep my thoughts churning at night. After the repetition of summer events, I crave the deafening silence of the damp forest. Instead of winding down from a season of racing and riding, there is an intangible force that urges me to keep the wheels turning, no matter what the prevailing conditions suggest." @yetibetisarah gets in some BC loam runs with @reubenkrabbe this fall.

This is what we can do with short travel and our newly configured Switch Infinity. It transcends the weight-weenie, uphill only models and replaces it with a precision riding bike. If some people assume it's a downhiller's XC bike, whatever… Call it what you want. For us, it's simply the bike we always wanted to build. The SB100. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth #NewBikeDay
Walk around the halls at Yeti and you’ll find women who can tear your legs off on the uphill and mock you on the downhill. The SB100 Beti quickly gained a reputation for its climbing ability and for how it descends. It's our genre-killing 100 mm trail machine, built for your next #ladyshred adventure. #YetiCycles #YetiBeti #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
P: @mdelormephoto
The SB100 is a strong XC climbing machine, but the gravity inspired geometry, 120mm @Fox 34 Step-Cast fork and meaty tires are all trail. The result is a perfect blend of pedaling efficiency with downhill prowess. It's the bike of choice for Yeti pro rider, @geoffkabush, as he defends his titles at the @BCBikeRace and Downieville Classic.

P: @craig_n_grant 
#YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MorethanMyth
For the SB100 and SB100 Beti, the look and layout of our Switch Infinity mechanism was changed to best work with our shorter travel 100mm platform. Switch Infinity utilizes a translating pivot point that allows us to tune the suspension kinematics to our desired characteristics. The SB100 Switch Infinity link is rotated 90 degrees to allow for slimmer, more efficient packaging and is lighter than the previous design. We worked with @Fox to independently test the mechanism for durability, and wear and tear in the harshest conditions - but shielded it with an easy to remove cover to keep the crud out. The SB100 Switch Infinity uses its own hardware but performs exactly like the original. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
Yeti pro rider @geoffkabush takes the win and defends his title @moabrocksmtb aboard the all-new SB100. Covering more than 75 miles and 9,500 feet of climbing, Kabush was rewarded with chunky, rocky descents that Moab serves up without fail. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth

"We'd dragged our good buddy, film-maker @joeyschusler, to the remote corner of southwest China to bikepack a high altitude circuit around three extraordinary mountains considered sacred by the Tibetan people. 
Known as the 'Yading Kora,' this multi-day pilgrimage beneath a triangle of snow-clad, 19,000-plus-foot peaks is a rite of passage for Tibetans. For these hardy plateau dwellers, a 'kor' - or completed circamambulation of mountains historically ordained as holy by various Dalai Lamas - will purify a lifetime of negative karma."

Betis - Beti Tribe Scotland is on. We want you, yes you - to join us. Colorado Beti @rgottfried joined us on our last International Beti Tribe Gathering in New Zealand. Here is what she had to say: "My @mountainbikeworldwide trip to New Zealand was my first experience on a guided trip, and it outlived my expectations in every way. I began the trip as an intermediate rider, slightly nervous about the riding difficulty and hours on the bike. It turned out everyone had the same nerves, and our guides worked with us to make sure the group started and ended the day with positive vibes, adjusting routes to account for our abilities and weather. I came home with stronger legs, more fitness, and a group of friends I now call family. The time and energy H&I put into this trip was evident— sign me up for the next adventure!" - Rachel Gottfried (Arvada, CO)

In the fall months racing isn't at the forefront of Yeti/Fox Factory team rider @shawnneer’s mind. He's still pushing limits however - limits of time, physics and mental fortitude - all aspects that make for a formidable opponent on the race track.

Rajesh Magar is @rjripper - after winning the Nepal mountain bike national championship three times consecutively, it became clear he is the fastest mountain biker in his country. First learning to ride on a bike he made, RJ made mountain biking his profession as a local guide. Join us on Wednesday, June 20th at Yeti Cycles' headquarters in Golden, CO to see RJ's story come to life thanks to the eye and talent of Yeti ambassador and filmmaker, @joeyschusler. 
The evening will include a happy hour of socializing, a food truck, drinks from @upslope, Joey’s films on the big screen, filmmaker Q&A, and a silent auction with a Yeti Cycles Frame, Fox Shox of your choice, and much more up for grabs. All proceeds will go to support RJ’s race fund and his visa bid to travel to the U.S. Tickets are $12. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #RJRipperFilm

Yeti ambassador, racer and the man behind #FollowCamFriday, @natehills1 was one of the first ambassadors to order up a SB100. Since Nate mainly focuses on enduro racing and shredding the most technical trails he can sniff out, we were waiting with somewhat bated breath to see his final build. It did not disappoint. For all you #bikenerds out there, here is his SB100 spec run down. "I built my 100 for light enduro\ down country use. I am running @srammtb Eagle XX1, Guide Ultimate brakes 180mm front and rear. The fork is a 130mm Pike that slackens the bike to about 67 degrees. I slapped a 36T chainring for max output and 150mm reverb seat post. Current tires are @maxxistires 2.5 Minnion DHF, 2.3 Aggressor combo on Roval Traverse SL Carbon 31mm id wheels. Final details are a 750mm wide bars, 50mm stem, MRP 1X chainguide and @ergonbike GD1 grips and saddle." Nate took this rig to Moab @endurocupmtb and placed second. We think that speaks for itself. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
"Mountain biking is a part of my soul. Life is all about mountain biking for me. No other job has given me what mountain biking has." He is @rjripper. Rising up from abject poverty to become Nepal's fastest mountain biker, Rajesh Magar has made a life and career of mountain biking. See @joeyschusler's most recent creation #RJRipperFilm at Yeti Cycles headquarters in Golden, Colo. this Wednesday, June 20th. Follow the link in our bio to purchase tickets and for more info. All proceeds go to benefit RJ's race fund and visa bid. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
Rajesh Magar learned from a young age that life wasn't always going to be easy. His mom noted that he understood his "circumstances at an early age. So, he started doing little odd jobs and saved up for months to buy a bicycle." That very bicycle was later seen as a distraction and sold, but that still didn't deter RJ. After all, he would come to be known as @rjripper. Nepal's fastest mountain biker, RJ is the subject of @joeyschusler's newest feature #RJRipperFilm. Come see it on the big screen as well as a few other of Joey's edits this Wednesday, June 20th at Yeti Cycles HQ in Golden, CO. All proceeds from ticket sales and silent auction, which includes a Yeti frame and your choice of suspension from Fox, will go towards RJ's visa bid and his plans to race internationally.

True to its reputation, the @world_enduro is dishing up wet conditions for its fourth installment of the season. With some of the longest stages in EWS history spanning the border between Austria and Slovenia, it will be a very physical race— steep trails, tight switchbacks, and a ridiculous amount of roots. If the weather brightens, conditions will be all-time. If the rain continues, the deathly slick roots and limestone will become treacherous.

The game makers were hard at work this weekend for Round 4 of the EWS in Austria and Slovenia and served up as promised, one of the most challenging stops in the history of the series. After 96.5 km (59.6 miles), 2,732 meters (8,963 feet) of climbing and  5,026 meters (16,489 feet) of descending over two days and two countries, the best riders in the world were worse for the wear. Sprained ankles, broken thumbs (@jubaldavis - heal up quick friend) and plenty of OTBs were tallied. At the end of day, @richie_rude1 and @shawnneer finished in mostly one piece 21st and 28th, respectively. We'll dust ourselves off and set sights for Round 5.

@richie_rude1 and @duncan_nason went one, two yesterday topping the Pro Men's podium at the third stop of the @bigmountainenduro series @keystone_resort. As is par for the course at Keystone, it was dry, dusty and loose. Familiar territory for Richie, his race plan for the weekend was to stay on @world_enduro pace - as such he put about a minute on his teammate by day's end. Stage 4 proved to be the most technical, but Richie made quick and tidy work of it, putting 20 seconds into his competition on that stage alone.

Teammate @jubaldavis was able to practice yesterday, but his thumb isn't quite ready for a day of grueling racing. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth

As @richie_rude1 made it to the Whistler Village last evening after a long day of racing, it was apparent that the day’s work which had him set up for a head-to-head battle on the final stage, wasn’t to be. Flats happen and there aren’t many people who can make it down in one piece riding 18 minutes on rubber, foam and rims. Great showing by teammates @shawnneer who took home 16th and @duncan_nason, finishing 22nd in Men’s U21. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth

In the northwest corner of Italy beneath the shadow of Mont Blanc lies the Aosta Valley. A vast interconnected system of trails flows thousands of meters down from the peaks above into the valley below, creating a grand playground for mountain bikers. With the heat of the summer in full force and the snowpack receding, Yeti/Fox Factory team rider @shawnneer and ambassador @leetrumpore took a mid-season break. They escaped to the high elevations to explore and kick back. In only a few short months, the mountains will be covered in snow once again. Get ridin’.

A mid-season break for Yeti/Fox Factory team rider  @shawnneer and Yeti Ambassador @leetrumpore landed the two in the idyllic Aosta Valley situated in the Italian Alps.

When you throw a leg over the all-new SB150, you'll find it rides strikingly similar to nothing. It rides bigger, climbs better and is difficult to put into a neat little box. Some may say it's too slack, too low, too long, too different just to say so. That’s fine. The SB150 isn’t for everyone. But riders who push this bike quickly become accustomed to their newfound capability. Learn more by following the link in our bio. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth #SB150

The SB5 - the original adventure seeker and perhaps our most versatile all-mountain bike. The first bike we made with Switch Infinity, the SB5 represents everything a trail bike should be - lightweight, nimble on climbs and dominant on descents. SB5, SB5 Beti, and the SB5 Lunch Ride are now all available in TURQ-Series and C-Series. All covered by Yeti's No-B.S. Lifetime Warranty. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #YetiBeti #MoreThanMyth
Out in the wild for mere days and the SB150 is already garnering praise from media around the world. @vitalmtb editor @brandon.turman jived with the SB150 right off the bat.
.
“No matter if you're casually pedaling or mashing on the cranks, railing berms or bashing the rough bits, the bike maintains a very calm, quiet feel the entire time. It's this trait that makes it possible to find your personal flow state faster and really jive with the bike and terrain."

We learned today that former Yeti racer @jaredgravesmtb has a brain tumor. He’s a legend by any definition. He has multiple world champion titles, represented Australia in the Olympics, and one of the most talented bike riders. Ever. And, he’s one of the most down-to-earth, friendly, professional racers you’ll ever meet. We’re proud to call him part of the Yeti family and want to send out good vibes and a speedy recovery as he heads into surgery.
Lab and track tested to downhill standards, the SB6 has the most stage wins of any EWS bike to date and is built to take a beating. New for 2019, we’ve added tunneled internal tubes for easier service in the pits. The @Fox 36, 170mm spec’d fork with a 37 mm offset ensures this bike is uniquely suited for taking on big terrain. Backed by Yeti's No-B.S. Lifetime Warranty.

One bike can’t rule them all, but the SB130 is one bike that rules. Conceived on rowdy Colorado trails and fed a steady diet of technical climbing and high speed descents, this bike crushes big terrain. We’re not suggesting you only need one bike, but if you did, this should be on your short list. Learn more by following the link in our bio.
#YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth #SB130
One bike that rules - SB130.

Yeti's proven Switch Infinity suspension is improved with new kinematics and more progressive geometry. The 77-degree seat tube angle and big wheels make it an unapologetic climber. Slightly shorter chainstays, slack headtube angle, long reach and a 44 mm offset fork ensures it’s flick-able and playful, but still rages on the downhill. Follow the link in our bio to learn more.

Yeti Pro Ambassador and #FollowCamFriday curator @natehills1 brings his new SB130 into the wild. “The SB130 is amazingly stable at speed - like, DH bike stable. For how long it feels initially, the rear end is short and still lets the bike feel playful. The low BB feels so sick in turns and the 77-degree seattube angle is amazing. After riding this bike, I realized I had been sitting on the tip of my saddle during climbs for years. Never have I experienced a bike that climbs well, feels stable going fast and can still turn on a dime.” #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth #SB130

Yeti Ambassador @morse.ah defines Yeti’s ride driven philosophy. A mechanical engineer by trade, mountain biking has always been the catalyst behind how he spends his free time. This year, he took on the ultimate challenge to race the entire @world_enduro series, while keeping his full-time job.

“There was a time, not that long ago, when you'd pick between either a cross-country bike or a downhill bike and that was mostly it. Nowadays, you could argue that there are at least four or five distinct categories, and then there are the bikes that blur the lines a bit. The SB100 is one of those niche bikes, but its capabilities are far from niche; it'll feel like an extremely capable cross-country bike to some, and an efficient, sharp-handling trail bike to others.” @pinkbike's Mike Levy reviews the #SB100.

.
“Yeti’s bikes have always looked amazing but the new SB150 is different animal. With 150mm travel on the rear, combined with a 170mm fork and a slack 64.3degree head angle, this modern 29er enduro bike is an absolute weapon on the descents, yet you can still beast everyone on the climbs. The suspension is superbly balanced and the sizing is on point."

Here is Joey’s advice to anyone taking on their first bike adventure: “The first and most important step is to commit 100% to going. Make the time, pick the route, and go. Finding a good route can be challenging, but scouring blogs, picking friends brains, searching maps, and obsessing over Google Earth until you find the route you are looking for usually does the trick. There are trails everywhere, and some great resources online for planning.”
.
“The next step is to figure out what gear is best for you, and best for the adventure at hand. Asking the right questions helps to dial in your adventure and make sure you are prepared. Will you be camping? Will it be cold? Hot? What are your water sources? Are these good sources? Are there any huts or towns along the way? How many days do you want to go for? How much food will you need? What gear can you bail on?”
.
“Ask yourself any and all questions you can muster, and hopefully you’ll be prepared enough. The best way to figure out your adventure planning though is previous experience. Every trip and adventure you go on, learn from it, figure out what worked best, and build off that on your next adventure. That’s really the best way to dial things in.” #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth

Yeti Ambassador, @jasonfitzgibbon is a wildlife biologist that spends his days as the co-founder and environmental director @tillakgoods where he develops and manages the Goods That Give Back program. Jason got his first mountain bike when he was 12, purchased with lawn mowing money and a little assistance from his dad. Since that day, he's worked tirelessly to preserve singletrack as he saw his favorite So Cal trails overtaken by tract housing and strip malls. In his role as a photographer and director @zangsfilms, Jason tells the stories of people and places preserving open space. . "It is my belief that the collective voice of the mountain bike community and the economic potential of mountain biking can be effectively leveraged to advocate for more open space and more trails. Keep an eye out for a film coming soon about the coastal town of Bandon, Oregon, and some of the new trails they’re putting in."

With all the uncertainty in the world, there are some things that remain constant. We’ve spent the last 35 years surrounded by a world-class crew we refer to as the Yeti Tribe. They’ve gotten us through epic rides after we’ve cracked and struggled to get home, we’ve shared more than few beers and they’ve provided friendship in good times and bad.

We all need a Tribe now. We all need to have each other’s back. We encourage everyone to stay safe, be sensible, and power on. We’re up for the challenge. We’re mountain bikers, after all.

“Ten times a day I get asked, 'Which Yeti Should I buy?' and I always struggle to answer.

Everyone is looking for that elusive unicorn bike — one that climbs like an XC rig and descends like a downhill bike. But I think we can all agree that this unicorn will never actually exist. That said, this is the closest thing I have found that lets me experience big days on technical terrain while not having to hold back one bit on the descents. The SB130LR is my idea of the perfect trail bike. It’s got the proper geometry and a perfect blend of efficiency and capability for the terrain I enjoy riding most. The coil out back just adds to the party.

My everyday smash wagon. SB130LR.” - @natehills1

#YetiCycles #RideDriven
Since much of our ability, and freedom to ride, race, and connect outdoors has been quelled, we’re now challenged to keep our stoke for mountain biking alive in different ways.

Throughout the years we’ve amassed a library of epic adventures, race recaps and tribe stories that showcase who we are to the core. Now seems like a great time to rediscover some rad stuff that keeps the stoke alive.

Until we can all get back out on dirt. 🤘

A crew of three set out to cover as much downhill ground possible without having much of a solid plan. Transportation hinged on fabled Canadian kindness getting strangers from point A to point B with bikes and gear in tow. “Our trio wasn't trying to prove anything, this carless yet car-dependent exercise-in-exercise wasn't meant to be an altruistic venture to dodge our carbon conscience. If anything, it was a strategic variant on friends' similar trips. They had pedaled every mile of asphalt in between and cherry picked singletrack. In our minds, that sounded like type-two fun. We wanted to use our saddle-sore budget on climbing and descending so we could enjoy the hour-plus descent on Jack The Ripper.

By no means is this an epiphany, it's one of those simple things that is hard to keep in mind. Adventure isn't exclusively hidden beyond the reach of the last cell tower, it's also subtly hidden inside common spaces, where it can be found by choosing a new perspective on the things we think we know.” - Reuben Krabbe

Health care workers have always taken care of us. Patching riders up countless times since 1985. So in an effort to give back and help the heroes on the front lines, we’ve temporarily refocused our production efforts to making PPE shields that help to extend the safe use of an N95 mask. Production began on Saturday and we’re ramping up to produce 1,000 shields a day. Thank you @smithoptics @blackdiamond  @uwmadison and @vcgraphix_ for the help.

We need your help getting in touch with those in need in Colorado. If you are a healthcare worker or first responder, please email us at donations@yeticycles.com. Or if you know someone in need, please share this post with them. Link in bio for more info.

“We typically design products from the ground up, but in this case we wanted an efficient way to make the most effective thing. Time is critical, so we’re doing it with materials we’ve pulled together from industry friends @smithoptics @blackdiamond  and @vcgraphix_ and what’s available through our supply chain. We’re building in our factory in Golden, CO. It’s not surprising, but everyone we contacted wanted to help and their help was critical in this coming together so quickly.” - Steve Hoogendoorn

This is a group effort made possible by our hardworking employees, industry friends at @smithoptics @blackdiamond  and @vcgraphix_ , and the community working to spread the word.

It’s our responsibility to step up to support our friends and neighbors when they need it most. When this is all over, we can show our gratitude over a cold one. Until then, let’s keep our frontline and health care providers protected.

With several miles and many races logged on his SB100, Yeti Ambassador @leejonathan_ writes his long term review. Check it out. “My favorite bike of all time, the @yeticycles #SB100. I’ve had two years refining this platform, and I’ve learned a lot along the way.

1. The rear end on this bike is so good that it’s hard to find a fork to match. It’s been tricky for me to get the SC34 to match like I wanted, but the @mrpbike Ribbon SL is a darn near perfect match. Initially supple but somehow supportive, a stable platform, and very progressive.

2. I up’d my spring rate in the rear with the fork change and am running 171psi as a result. It removes a hair of the initial suppleness, but makes the bike incredibly composed when you are on the gas.

3. This bike likes responds increasingly favorably as rider input progresses, even in the gnarliest terrain. In other words, take control of this thing, slap berms, send drops and go for the risky line with confidence – it’ll reward you.

This bike is the only one that gives me #newbikeday feels every time I ride it, and I can’t wait to build up my 2020 and test out a couple changes. Cheers to race bikes, cheers to short travel and big wheels, and cheers to the bike your XC bike warned you about.” - Jonathan Lee

If anyone can boost that high charging uphill, it’s Richie Rude.

“Race up, race down. The new @yeticycles SB115 is a blast to ride here in @visitgcb. At 115mm it still gives me the confidence to race down trails like 409.5 and Doctors Park. It’s a pleasure to ride a light, sharp bike up the hills and be rewarded with that same feeling going back down. No compromise here.” - @richie_rude1

Frame: @yeticycles SB140 / Medium, painted by @tec_gnar
Shock: short-stroked @ridefoxbike DPS shock for 125mm
Fork: Fox 36 dropped from 160mm to 140mm+full tokens
Wheels: @envecomposites M730 rims (27.5”) built around @chriskingbuzz’s new violet ISO hubs
Tires: @maxxistires Ikon tires (45psi, tubeless).
Stem: @envecomposites M7 carbon stem
Handlebar: ENVE M7 carbon bar 40mm rise
Grips: @deitycomponents Lockjaw grips
Pedals: Deity Bladerunner pedals
Chain Ring: @absoluteblack.cc 30t oval ring / Chris King Violet edition (not in production)
Extras: @stikrd Purple chrome full-bike decal kit
The oddities: Only a rear brake (SRAM G2) because it won't be doing much downhill. Rigid carbon seatpost trimmed to 6" long, for light weight and minimalism. 7-speed SRAM drivetrain, since I don't plan to climb much and am hoping a short-cage derailleur will be lighter/stronger. The derailleur is run by a mini, modified GripShift, because I don’t want the shifter triggers getting stuck in my belt or pockets on tuck no-handers. To shift I use just the flange and otherwise have a full lock-on grip for normal riding.

When Yeti Cycles started thirty-five years ago, the founders felt strongly about building a community that was founded on racing and the belief that mountain bikes make us better people. We shared this with our friends at the races, at festivals and ultimately at Yeti Tribe Gatherings, where hundreds gather each year to ride epic trails, and enjoy the camaraderie of post ride beers and stories together.

We’ve referred to this crew as the Yeti Tribe – a community of people who love to ride mountain bikes. The notion of tribe was appealing to us because it was community-centric, familial, and had strong social values.

Recently, we’ve learned our use of the term “Tribe” can be offensive to indigenous people, due to the violent history they have endured in the United States.  The word “Tribe” is a colonial construct that was used to marginalize Native Americans and its continued use by non-Indigenous People fails to accurately recognize their history and unique status as Tribal Nations.

After discussion with members of the indigenous community, studying accurate representations of our shared history, and reflecting on our values as a company, Yeti Cycles has decided we will no longer use the term “Tribe” in our marketing.

The community we have built will move forward and thrive. Yeti Gatherings will continue to be our most valued events of the year. We have walked away from a word, but the soul of our community remains intact. We ask you all to join us in embracing this change.

Thanks to the mountain bike community for your guidance and especially to the members of the Indigenous community for educating us on this issue.

See you on the trail.

A foundation that serves to educate and provide access and opportunity that advance diversity and inclusion in cycling. All of us at Yeti Cycles, along with the other founding members @fox, @santacruzbicycles, @redbull, @pinkbike, Be Good Foundation, are all in it to provide paths for cycling to become a life-long passion. Collectively, we are all committed to support Grow Cycling Foundation and their four pillars of “education, opportunity, community and access that create solutions and provide entry points at various steps of a cyclist’s journey.”

We’ll keep you updated on how Yeti is helping work towards this mission. In the meantime, follow Elliot and @growcyclingfoundation as we work together to make cycling more inclusive and welcoming to all.

@yeticycles demo driver @leah.vanderlinden suffered a broken femur and tibia in October 2019 and has undergone multiple surgeries and countless hours of PT. In less than 10 months she has gone from a walker to full-send, taking first place in the Pro Women’s Air DH at the Trestle Gravity.

“With not much going on this summer, we’ve been trying to stay as busy as we can. I called Nic up randomly one afternoon and asked if he wanted to check out this little freeride zone in central Utah. A couple of days later, we found ourselves out there with a couple bikes, cameras, and camping supplies. We hiked a couple of faces before the sun went down, made some questionable food, camped under the stars, and woke up at sunrise to do the same thing before it reached 100 degrees. This place is so fun! Planning on making more trips like this. Freeride or die!”  - @reedboggs

“My bike set up is fairly simple for everything I need it to do. It leans more on the gravity side of things but works extremely well for pedaling and long transfers. People always comment on my bars, but I like them pretty narrow for control, comfort, and to squeeze through trees. I don't change my setup, so I'm always used to it and am never surprised by anything in sketchy situations. I also run my suspension really fast, not totally sure why, but that's how I like it. I use my SB150 for everything because I really believe it's the most versatile bike out there! “ - @warrenkniss

Grow Cycling Foundation is focused on making cycling more accessible and provide opportunities that haven’t been there before. The keystone of Grow Cycling Foundation will be a new pump track in a diverse area of Los Angeles. The pump track will serve as a community fixture that exposes people to the love for biking, as well as create cycling-centric pathways for career and life development.

To kick off support for this amazing program, Grow Cycling / Yeti / FOX SB150 Giveaway Sweepstakes will be giving out a fully decked out SB150. And we mean decked out: new Fox 38 fork and Float X2 shock, @rideshimano XTR drivetrain, and all the other bells and whistles you could want.

Yeti and FOX products are donated and all proceeds of the Yeti x FOX Giveaway Sweepstakes go to benefit the Grow Cycling Foundation.

Yeti Ambassador @leejonathan_ is methodical about his builds. His #SB130 is no different.

“The SB130 is my favorite mountain bike I’ve ever owned, and I’ve built it up in a way to allow it to be super versatile. It’s the perfect middle-ground bike. This bike weighs 28.6 lbs (12.9kgs) with these tires and drops all the way down to 27 lbs with the trail tire setup. Since this isn’t my XC race bike, weight is not a priority – ride quality and fun are the focus points on this trail bike.”

Dan Milner reimagines what can be done out his back door.

“When your world gets turned upside down, you have to reach for self-righting mechanisms; and when my plans as a global-travel photographer got put by the pandemic-shaped wayside, I knew I still needed a taste of adventure in my life — I’d just have to find it locally instead. Think global, act local, right? I rode from my backdoor, pedaling, then pushing, and finally shouldering my #SB140 to the top of the nearest peak, 4600 ft above home, where I knew, even between lockdowns, I’d find no-one else. Alone for a night, surrounded by huge vistas and a vast starry sky, I had the chance to find some context in the strange and challenging world that had suddenly fallen on us, reconnecting with the dirt, the rocks, and the damp grass around my bivouac and refocussing on life skills at their simplest level; brewing tea and listening out for wolves.

It was just one night. But it was one night when I had certainty in 10 months of chaos, and I’m thankful for that. All it took was some lateral thinking, some sweat, and a bike.” - @danmilnerphoto

Yeti Ambassador, Max Fierek tested positive for Lyme disease when he was nine years old, since then he has fought fatigue, lung capacity, muscle fatigue, short term memory loss and mood swings. For @mtbfierek, living with Lyme disease for half his life has taught him empathy for others and to cherish his time outside in nature which helps him stay positive and fight for his love of mountain biking.

Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia Burgdorferi. If lyme disease isn’t treated promptly or effectively symptoms can last weeks, months or even years after the tick bite.

For more information about how to prevent and treat Lyme disease, visit @lymetimes.

A typical year for Yeti / @fox Factory Team athlete, Shawn Neer consists of 6 months of traveling the world racing on some of the most physically and mentally daunting tracks the @world_enduro has to offer. Shawn has taken to his backyard trails in absence of his usual international racing schedule. Repetition breeds muscle memory and speed that toes the line between fast as hell and dangerous.

"As much of a bummer covid turned out to be in 2020. The silver lining turned out to be heaps more time training on local trails for race prep. I have never felt better on my bike and couldn't be more excited to get between the tape again. Bring on the race nerves and adrenaline. Looking forward to the 2021 race season with Richie and the team!" - @shawnneer

Every now and then, someone passes through your life and their positive energy is so strong that everyone around them is affected. Sam Schneider, a Yeti staffer, was that guy. He was stoked on life and mountain biking above all else. No matter the situation, he always found the sliver of positivity (or even the whole slice) embraced it, and spent his 20 years making everyone around him smile. We’d all benefit from taking a page from Sam’s book. 

Sam lost his battle with cancer earlier this week, and we’re still trying to wrap our heads around it. We’ll remember his kind spirit, his infectious smile, and we know he’s shredding heavenly trails. Rest in Peace, Sam. You will be missed.

“Winning is core to Yeti, that much is clear. But to truly be a Yeti racer, you need to be more than that. Yeti racers have to have the right attitude, they have to be a part of the support system and they need to want to be part of a team. While mountain biking may be a solo sport, racing at this level means looking beyond individual performance — sharing line choices and cornering techniques. Fully supporting one another, ready and willing with a smile and a fist bump, no matter what happens out on the course.” - James Stokoe

Time to shake off the nerves - the Yeti / @FOX race team is out in force at @windrockbikepark for the Tennessee National. The weather has held steady all week; then rain rolled in moments before Rude’s seeding run - instantly turning the top layer of dust into clay.

@richie_rude1 exercised caution, accepting an earlier start over the risk that the slick course posed, landing him 14th during seeding.

Following today’s practice, @richie_rude1, @shawnneer, @jubaldavis, @quinnreece, and @warrenkniss will get their final practice day in tomorrow before the three-stage enduro on Sunday.

Although the pair are 10,000 miles apart, they’ve been gearing up for a fully booked 2021 race season – Crankworx, EWS, Trans BC, and XCO just to name a few. @jaredgravesmtb and @kasper_woolley will race together for the first time at the first round of the @world_enduro in Italy.

The Yeti / @oneupcomponents Pro Team has the deck stacked with combination of heritage, pedigree, raw talent and skill to an almost unfair degree. The pair is driven and hungry for results. Tune in this season as races are almost underway.

The tiny town of Ironton, MO is unassuming and not somewhere you would first think of for a bike park. However small, the 600 vertical feet bike park served up some proper technical jank for the first @bigmountainenduro of the 2021 race season.

In this episode of TYTM,@martyschaffer talks with world-renowned photo documentarian Dan Milner about the niche he's carved capturing the rich social and cultural journeys that accompany his punishingly long epic rides. Dan has a unique ability to garner amazingly vivid images in an array of consequential environments and self admits to relishing in the pain cave.

It’s been almost two years since we have raced on the world stage. The team is hungry to see exactly how they stack up against the most competitive roster at the first @world_enduro of the 2021 race season. The extended off-season stands to split the field between those who remained laser-focused on blistering track speed - from those who haven’t.

Last time @richie_rude1 raced here, he dominated the field with a win 18-second margin, winning 4-of-5 stages, and teammate @shawnneer finished an impressive 18th. This is @kasper_woolley ’s first time at this venue while racing on the Yeti / OneUp Pro Team, and we are stoked to see what he can do.

We’re kicking off the 2021 @world_enduro season in true @richie_rude1 fashion.

Rude claims the first win of the season by just under half a second at the first of the two EWS events week in Canazei, Italy. Yeti / @FOX Factory teammate, @shawnneer felt fast and was happy with his track speed in the beginning of the day, but stage four proved difficult and ended the day with a couple crashes. Neer placed 25th overall. Still amongst some fast company

Yeti / OneUp Pro Team rider, @kasper_woolley is one week post getting the all clear for riding. His aimed for smooth, clean runs, and he did exactly that. Woolley placed 47th overall, but stands only to gain strength and speed throughout the season.

One race down, one to go of the Val di Fassa double header. With a brand new racing format for 2021, the second event, only three days away, is still up for grabs and is anyones game.

Full race report tomorrow.

Late day rain in Canazei lead to a last-minute swap for today’s Pro Stage. As all practice on this stage was dry, no one knew how the new track would ride wet. Rather than a conservative run, Rude made the call to fully send it. And it paid off. He put five seconds over the second-place finish.

Tune in tomorrow to see how @richie_rude1, @shawnneer, and @kasper_woolley do.

@richie_rude1 claimed the top spot at EWS.3 La Thuile yesterday despite less than ideal conditions for stage three and four when the rain set in, winning stages one, two, and four (QS).

@kasper_woolley made the leap into the top ten, finishing 7th overall. A week of training and suspension testing in Finale, Italy, was exactly what Woolley needed to get back up to speed.

Yeti / @FOX Factory teammate, @shawnneer had an off race, crediting his lack of wet training time. Knowing what he needs to improve, he is looking forward to his chance for redemption in La Thuile.

@richie_rude1 left it all between the tape in the second half of the La Thuile doubleheader. He maintained the lead he earned in yesterday’s Pro Stage until Stage Four. Despite a P11 on S4, Rude ended the day strong and on the podium once again with a second-place finish.

@kasper_woolley finished the day 13th, and @shawnneer placed 94th after a fall on Stage Three that changed the course of his day.

Rude was able to claim the lead straight out of the gate and it remained that way throughout the entire eight-stage race.

Yeti / @FOX teammate, @shawnneer ended the day 5th despite a lingering hip injury from La Thuile. @lauren_bingham_ and @quinnreece continue to deliver top ten results with a P6 and P10 respectively.

The Yeti / @FOX Factory, National, Devo Team as well as the Yeti / OneUp Pro Team crew has rolled into Winter Park with a fully stacked roster, with almost every race athlete getting between the tape for the third @bigmountainenduro of the season.

Practice day was in true Trestle fashion - hot and dry, a far cry from the showy welcome we had in 2020. There is no room for mistakes with only four stages in tomorrow’s one day race.

Tune in tomorrow as @richie_rude1 , and @kasper_woolley once again battle for the top of the box at The Winter Park BME

The Aussie and Canadian duo that is the Yeti / OneUp team raced for the first time together since its creation in 2020. @jaredgravesmtb and @kasper_woolley finished 3rd and 4th, respectively.

Devo Team rider @quinnreece put it all together this weekend and earned himself a 5th place spot and his first podium of the 2021 season.

With the Yeti / @FOX Factory Team in transit to Europe, it’s the Nat / Devo Team’s turn to shine. @quinnreece , @warrenkniss , and @lauren_bingham_ have put in two solid days of practice and are ready to take on the steep, loose tracks that Purgatory is serving up. Equal parts techy descent and soul-crushing transfers mean that endurance will play a large role in determining success throughout the weekend.

Stages one - four are on deck for tomorrow, with stages five and six on Sunday. This is looking to be one of the rowdiest @bigmountainenduro stops this year, be sure to tune in tomorrow to see how it all unfolds.

Four tracks down, two to go. The terrain at Purgatory is relentless, and it’s not letting up for day two.

Day one held a mix of flow trail and huge drops. After over 14 minutes of racing, @warrenkniss, @quinnreece, and @lauren_bingham_ sit 5th, 10th, and 9th, respectively, in the Pro Men’s and Women’s fields.

It’s about time.

While the name of the game is speed, we took our time to craft an e-MTB worthy of our race and brand heritage. Half a decade worth of development later, and the world’s first race-specific e-MTB is born.

Meet the 160E.

#YetiCycles #160E #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
With just 140 points separating @richie_rude1 and Jack heading into round seven, a win here was crucial to remain in contention for the overall series title.

Rude understood the assignment. He took the Pro Stage win and maintained his first place standing throughout the entire race – taking home the maximum points available and reclaiming the series lead. Teammate, @shawnneer had a few top ten finishes between the EWS and EWS-E, proving his track speed is there.

Yeti / OneUp Pro Team’s @kasper_woolley continued to push his pace. Feeling at home on the steep, rooty terrain, he took fourth-place finish on the Pro Stage and continued the momentum on Stage Two with a P5. “I felt like I was riding really well, but just had a few weird, little slip ups. Happy to still hold onto sixth with three crashes today.”

The Yeti team has raced Finale Ligure many times over, but the brand new Pro Stage proved to be a challenge for nearly the entire field. The raw, brand new track was steep with super-tight back-to-back switchbacks and jank nearly everywhere. With nothing yet burned in, line choice was paramount

Less than a second separate Rude and Moir going into Stages 2-5. Tune in as tomorrow unfolds.

“Long day in the saddle today, our first kind of big pedal weekend. But yeah, a little bit off the pace today – kind of annoying. I felt really good, just wasn’t on the pointy end I guess. I got fired up for the last stage and got second on that with some good points going into the final race. I gotta go for the win in Scotland. Treat it like any other race, just be confident and put down a good one.” - Richie Rude. He finished the weekend in 5th overall.

Trailing by just 70 points, you can bet that Rude will leave it all on the dirt as he chases down the title with everything he’s got.

Rude claims 2nd overall for the 2021 @world_enduro season despite being unable to compete in the final round. “There was some confusion on the bottom of the Pro Stage regarding gates and tape and I unfortunately got the shit end of the stick when I decided to go around one of them and I shouldn’t have. The ol’ commissaires decided to throw me a DQ and cut my weekend short and any chances of going for the overall win. Yeah, so that was a bit of a bummer for sure. I couldn’t be happier having this season and how it went.” - @richie_rude1

@kasper_woolley clinched yet another top-ten finish, taking 7th on the day and 12th overall.  Don’t let Kappy’s casual and slightly sarcastic race day demeanor fool you. Woolley is a weapon on the bike and a name to watch in 2022.

@shawnneer had a big week on the pedals between the EWS and EWS-E. “I am really jiving with the 160E. It would be nice we had a day off in between the races, but its time on the bike and it’s what we love to do.” Neer placed 12th in the EWS-E with top-ten finishes in 7 of 14 stages, and 43rd in the EWS.

And with that, the 2021 race season is over. We’d like to extend a massive thank you to our sponsors and everyone who helps make our race program what it is.

Durango holds a special place in Yeti’s heritage, so it’s fitting that the resurrection and return of the event should be in Durango as well. The spirit of the San Juan’s, built by the gold rush and maintained by an ongoing optimism and love for the outdoors, keeps Durango special. It’s the perfect spot for us Yeti Freaks to gather, find common ground and remind each other that the brand is about the people, not just the bikes.

After blowing a tire on his first run, @reedboggs knew exactly what he needed to do for his second attempt. Boggs cleaned his second run with confidence, style, and ease – nailing every drop and trick he set out to attempt. He knew it, and so did the judges. That run earned him his first ever Rampage podium, claiming third overall amongst some of the biggest legends in freeride.

Boggs is no longer a name that you will find on the alternate list. After this past weekend, Reed has officially arrived.

“This year is a statement. I just want to prove to these guys that I deserve to be in the mix.”

It took time to make time. 
From the first alloy mule, to the final product you see today, the 160E is over five years in the making. The 160E is the brainchild of Stretch and our entire Engineering and Product teams; and Jared Graves. Olympian and two time world champion - a sommelier of bikes. 
Creating a new bike from scratch is a long, arduous process. But one done out of our commitment to racing and development.

“My #SB130 is built up from scratch for the conditions on my favorite trails in Squamish. I’m borderline on Yeti sizing but like the Large SB130 for the more technical and tight trails. The Lunch Ride option with extra travel and the X2 rear shock to tilt it more towards the gravity side. DoubleDown @maxxisbike tires F/R to keep up with it’s capability and full @rideshimano for reliability up North. A few orange touches with the @oneupcomponents chainguide and custom Lizard Skins grips make the bike special to me.” - @geoffkabush

Two years and a Red Bull Rampage Podium later, we could not be more excited and proud to announce our continued partnership for the next three years.

Cheers, Reed. Stoked to see what 2022 brings.

Getting over 20 Yeti freaks together in Madeira for the International Gathering last fall was made just that much more special after the 2020 hiatus.

“The crew was simply stoked to be riding with people who were having as much fun as they were.” A week of bikes, crashes, beer, and commodore later, we left thankful that we were able to gather and share the epic trails the little province of Portugal had to offer.

Richie Rude once again leads the Yeti / FOX Factory Race Team alongside Kasper Woolley, previously of the Yeti / OneUp Pro Team. Rounding out the 2022 Factory Team is Bex Baraona - a new addition to the Yeti family we could not be more excited about.

Riding for the National Team this year is new rider, Kate Lawrence, accompanied by Warren Kniss, who is returning to the team after multiple podiums in 2021.

Quinn Reece will be joined by Jack Brown to complete the Devo Team roster.

See you between the tape.

We had a total blast riding, hanging, chatting, and general fun having with everyone this weekend. Thanks to all who came out to join us. 12th annual #YetiCycles #YetiTribe gathering in the books.
Early morning on the #YetiTribe group ride. Who all enjoyed #Telluride this weekend? What a place.
A land largely unaffected by the progress of man, the Tetons Range and the surrounding areas are a pristine ecosystem inhabited by a vast diversity of wildlife spreading across multiple national parks. Uninhibited by foothills on the eastern side the range rises sharply and splits upper Wyoming and lower Idaho in two. On one side sits Jackson Hole, home to the legendary ski area and playground to outdoor junkies. On the other resides the Teton Valley: a landscape dotted with hay farms and the small rustic towns of eastern Idaho. Smack in the middle, off the pass that separates the two, lies some of the most progressive mountain bike trails in America. Local riders teaming with the Forest Service have created a network of trails designed and built specifically for riding. We explored both sides of the pass and rode varied terrain from purpose-built bike park features to backcountry singletrack, clinging to the edge of 10,000-foot peaks. The experience instilled a sense in us that the locals have got it figured out here… and the need for a satellite Yeti office in JH. #ProvenHere #Tetons video online now at YetiCycles.com

Windproof, comfortable, cut for bike use, and the list goes on…all the reasons why the Smuggler Hoody is the perfect, all-around piece for cool days.

The Yeti Tribe is a diverse group that shares our same devotion to owning and riding great bikes. Liz joined the tribe at the start of last summer when she got her first Yeti. Riding at any chance she could, her skills have improved incredibly in just a few short months. More importantly, she has learned how to have an incredible amount of fun on her bike each and every time she hits the trail. | #YetiCycles #SB66C #YetiTribe @long_live_lemon
Don't call us between 11:30 and 1:00. We won't be here. Every day, weather permitting, we shut our doors, turn on the answering machine and head out for a ride at lunch. With the headquarters situated at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, our local trails are just a few pedal stokes away. This daily opportunity to get out and ride is a large part of why many started working here, but at the same time, it allows us to test and refine new models, try out component spec, or just drop the boss on a climb. It is core to the process behind the bikes we design and manufacture.

The 2014 enduro season opener for myself and fellow Yeti Cycles Ambassador Nate Hills may have been the most demanding, intense, and adventurous event either of us have ever done. We embarked on our journey to South America with the intent to compete in the Andes Pacifico Enduro and then continue on after the event to explore the endless rugged peaks of the Andes. | Check the latest adventures from Yeti Ambassadors @joeyschusler & @natehills as they explore Chile with @smithoptics.

When we first started planning our weeklong backcountry bike-packing trip to Peru, bringing the newly redesigned Yeti 575 was the natural choice. The adventure would be self supported in some of the most rugged mountains in the world, the Huayhuash Range tucked high up in the Peruvian Andes, and what we needed most in a bike was reliability. With a simplistic design and a durable aluminum chassis, the 575 held up to the test as we managed to navigate the demanding terrain without a single mechanical. What the bike lacks in high-tech features and carbon fiber proved to be its greatest assets. Stay tuned to see the entire photo feature and film from @joeyschusler & @thomaswoodson dropping online at the end of April. | #YetiCycles #Yeti575
Road trip!!! Over the next few weeks we will be exploring the southwest in search of warmer weather and dusty trails. Moab, Sedona, and everything in between never disappoints. | #YetiCycles #ProvenHere

This weekend marks the first round of the 2014 @world_enduro. Last season @jaredgravesmtb placed second overall. You can bet that he won't settle for anything but that top spot this time around. Let's go racing! | #YetiCycles
A solid start to the long season ahead for the Yeti race team. @jaredgravesmtb was on the attack all week at @world_enduro Round One in Chile. He ended up second place overall, hot on the heels of Jerome Clementz. | #YetiCycles
This past January, Yeti Cycles ambassadors @joeyschusler, @thomaswoodson, and @samwseward ventured to the remote Huayhuash range in the Peruvian Andes in search of an epic ride. What they found far surpassed their expectations. Follow along this week as we share images from their adventure and stay tuned for the short film and multimedia feature launching on @bikemag next Monday. | #YetiCycles #HuayhuashFilm
Current Junior Downhill World Champion @richie_rude1 had never raced a big enduro event before this past weekends @world_enduro in Chile. While he didn’t get the exact result he was gunning for, he still had quite a respectable showing for being the new kid on the block. Look for Richie to be climbing the ranks throughout the season. The kid is a powerhouse on the bike. | #YetiCycles #SB66C
The beauty seen riding in the Cordillera Huayhuash is unrivaled. The extreme elevation of the trail (almost all above 14,000ft) and remote nature of the zone make it a difficult place to get to, but it's almost always worth it. Yeti ambassadors @joeyschusler, @samwseward, and @thomaswoodson went fully self supported on this loop for 8 days.

Spring is here which means it’s now officially time to hit the trails. The SB75 is a great all around trail bike perfect for those drawn to epic weekend rides or just a quick early morning loop before work. Check out a #SB75 for yourself at your local Yeti dealer. | #YetiCycles | Photo by @davetrumporephoto
Aluminum in the front, carbon in the rear. The SB95 comes in at just a half pound heavier than the full carbon SB95C version, at a price that is much more affordable. The carbon rear end, now standard, increases the stiffness while giving the bike a much more lively ride. Top that with great availability and the new SB95 is a no brainer for your new summer ride. Check one out today at your local Yeti dealer. | Yeti Ambassador @lydlovesmud ripping on the Colorado Trail earlier this week. | #YetiCycles #SB95
Racing doesn't always go quite as planned and even the best have tough days now and then. A rough start to the Soctland @world_enduro leaves @jaredgravesmtb hungry for more on the race track tomorrow. | #YetiCycles
@jaredgravesmtb had a solid second day of racing at the Scotland round of the @world_enduro. He clawed his way to 8th place overall after sitting way back in 30th after day one, and topped off the weekend with taking a stage win on the very last stage. | #YetiCycles

@jaredgravesmtb claims these trails in BC are some of the best he's ever ridden. Not a bad place then to shoot a video of him pushing the limits of his new #SwitchInfinity equipped #SB6C | #YetiCycles #ProvenHere
The SB6C was built as a pure enduro machine and proved it's mettle on the EWS circuit.

Wishing the best of luck to the team this weekend! @world_enduro | #YetiCycles #SwitchInfinity #SB6C
It's hard to beat Colorado riding in the fall. Cold crisp air, empty trails, tacky dirt, a dusting of snow on the high peaks, and golden aspen trees galore. A crew of Yeti riders and ambassadors met up this past week for one last riding trip to the high country for the year. Stay tuned for more images and video from the trip in the following months. | #YetiTribe #YetiFallGathering #ColoradoFall | Photo: @joeyschusler

Jared Graves the reigning Enduro World Series champion is considered one of the most versatile mountain bikers in the world and when not racing, he’s all about having good times on the bike. “It’s all about going out in the bush with your mates and riding natural terrain, whatever you can find really and just having fun.” Following his victory at the Whistler EWS, Jared traveled deep into the Kootenay region of British Columbia. | Photo: Craig Grant

As you can see, our friends over at @camp4collective don't always adhere to the norm. They love mountain biking and all things extreme, which can lead to some interesting results when they let the cameras roll. They asked if they could ride the new #SB6C off a cliff and we hesitantly said yes. What we witnessed was a rare moment of complete awe as @slanders_ made the big leap.

@justin_reiter recounts his experience on the 500 mile Colorado Trail thru-ride that he completed last summer with some fellow Yeti Ambassadors, "The days and miles passed. Some slower than others. And others not slow enough. Adventures like this calm the mind, rekindle to simple love for riding, and will certainly never be forgotten by those who experience them.” | Full story and video online next Wednesday. | @justin_reiter @craigjones250 @sam_seward @joeyschusler | #YetiTribe #ColoradoTrail #ARCc #ASRc
Sometimes the most challenging and arduous adventure is the one right in your own backyard. The Colorado Trail links up the states largest metropolitan region with some of the best mountain bike trails in the country, spanning over 500 miles through the rugged and scenic alpine wilderness from Denver to Durango. This past summer a group of Colorado based Yeti Ambassadors set out to give it a go for themselves. | See the entire story and video, online now via the link in our profile. | @justin_reiter @craigjones250 @sam_seward @joeyschusler | #YetiTribe #ColoradoTrail #ARCc #ASRc
The Colorado Trail is the ultimate backyard adventure for us mountain bikers living in Colorado.

Riding in the fall is one of our favorite pastimes. This past October, Yeti ambassadors @shawnneer, @michael_hlarsen, @piphunt, and Rudy Unrau hit the road for a week of riding in Colroado’s peak season. | New video and photo set online now, link in profile. | #YetiTribe #YetiFallGathering #CrestedButte #ColoradoFall
There is a small window in the Colorado high country when the trail conditions are perfect. Some would call it fall, but nature is fickle here -- often the warm days of summer push up against the sting of winter. In the high country, cold winds blow and snow dusts the peaks. Lower in the valley, aspens drop their leaves and cover the trails in a vibrant carpet of red, gold, and orange. Motivated by the oncoming threat of winter and the desire for one last chance to ride the state's best single track, Yeti Ambassadors @michael_hlarsen, @shawnneer, @piphunt, and Rudy Unrau hit the road to enjoy Colorado's peak season. | Link to full video in profile. | #YetiTribe #YetiFallGathering #ElkMountains #CrestedButte #SwitchInfinity #SB6c #SB5c | Photo by: @joeyschusler

Fall in Colorado is fickle. Winter often comes early, as was the case on the Yeti Ambassador trip this past October. @michael_hlarsen caught out in a blizzard that moved in quickly on the 401 trail. | #YetiTribe #YetiFallGathering

Every year hundreds of Yeti Freaks from all over the world journey to the mountains of Colorado for a weekend of epic riding, tasty food, cold beer, antics, and camaraderie. This year we took the festivities down to Durango, Colorado, a place where much of Yeti’s history and roots lie.  Here we had amazing trails at our disposal and some of the best views that the state has to offer. | Check out the full video, link in profile | #YetiCycles #YetiTribe | Photo by: @davetrumporephoto

We only got to scratch the surface of the trails at Izoard, trails that on the map run out in every direction for tens of miles. For me as the photographer, the bad weather actually served up a lot more atmosphere than we'd have had with sunshine, really helping pick out the rock formations. For Jared and Richie, they got to throw the bikes around on some very loose corners that felt more like the Dolomites than the Alps. | #YetiCycles #SwitchInfinity #SB5c | Riders: @jaredgravesmtb & @richie_rude1 Photo: Dan Milner
What do you do with two riders fresh from the Valloire EWS stage? Send them to nearby La Grave for a week with photographer Dan Milner to juggle training programs, massive calorific intakes and nailing images aboard their new SB5c bikes.

@jaredgravesmtb playing on his SB5c in the evening light of La Grave, France. | #SwitchInfinity #SB5c #RideDriven | Photo by: Dan Milner
La Grave is not known as a mountain bike Mecca. It's steep and unforgiving. In the winter it's two curious lifts hurl backcountry skiers straight into 10,000ft off-piste descents that dodge glacial crevasses and seracs. In summer, its five dedicated trails carry a similar feel: committing. But, just outside the resort, we found trails that oozed flow like an over-ripe Brie. | #YetiCycles #SwitchInfinity #SB5c | Riders: @jaredgravesmtb & @richie_rude1 Photo: Dan Milner
The official bike trails at La Grave have consistency. Beginning above tree line they are steep, rocky and technical. Once in the trees, they are steep, rooty and technical. It was a great proving ground for the SB5c's ride-anything capabilities. | #SwitchInfinity #SB5c #YetiCycles | Riders: @jaredgravesmtb & @richie_rude1 Photo: Dan Milner

The SB6c is full of surprises.

Green River, Utah has become well known over the years as one of the most iconic freeride mountain biking locations. Towering book cliffs, soft dirt, and complex terrain make for some of the most unique riding on earth. And while a full on DH rig is typically the bike of choice for such burly terrain, we had different plans. We hit the road to Green River with Yeti Ambassador and local Colorado shredder @shawnneer. Our plan was to tackle the large lines seen in the magazines and movies on a Yeti SB6c trail bike. Upon arrival, a hillside with endless possibilities lay before us. Before we knew it we had found our groove for the week; building lines, riding at the edge of our limits, and enjoying the quaint and laid back atmosphere of Green River. It was a much welcomed week of excitement in the midst of the cold Colorado winter months. | #SB6c #SwitchInfinity #YetiCycles #RideDriven | Rider: @shawnneer Photo by: @joeyschusler

To celebrate our 30th Anniversary we've kitted out our factory race team in some special one-off throwback jerseys, with the classic Yeti turq and yellow color way. They will be running them for the remaining two EWS rounds. 
We'll also be giving away two of the jerseys, signed by @jaredgravesmtb & @richie_rude1. All you have to do is like this post and tag three friends in the comments below to be entered to win one at random.

Sometimes the best moments of a ride are when you take a break, look around, and enjoy the view. Here the Yeti crew takes a break high above Verbier in the Swiss Alps with our two-wheel drifting guide for the day Bart. The view was fleeting as the skies opened up and torrential rains flooded down the peaks into the valley. Unfazed Bart lead team riders Richie and Joey down the slippery trails and into the forest where they played a game of cat and mouse, sliding in out and out of every corner. A day to remember. #YetiCycles

Mountain biking is fairly new to Iceland. While plenty of people go there to ride annually, the infrastructure for mountain biking isn't yet fully developed. Sometimes our hunt for trail was rewarded with pristine sections of singletrack, such as this beautiful trail located in Landmannalaugar.

The Caucasus Mountains are the real deal. They are known as Europe’s highest peaks, towering in altitude above the Alps. This rugged range is located on the border with Georgia and Russia, at the nexus of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The region has a rich and troubled history, filled with violence, war, and hardship. We found nothing but gorgeous and vast empty landscapes; It’s hard to image this place as anything but peaceful and serene.

For over a decade, the Yeti Tribe Gathering has become an annual pilgrimage for those who own Yeti mountain bikes. Affectionately known as Yeti freaks, they come from all walks of life and from around the globe to meet each year for epic rides and a weekend of great food, cold beer, and planned stupidity. For our inaugural international Tribe Gathering, we went big and ventured into the high mountains of Nepal, home of the mythical Yeti. #YetiCycles #YetiTribe

The Yeti/Fox Racing team gets a shot of new blood this year with the high style and gravity expertise of Cody Kelley (@kelleymtb) winner of the 2014 Dual Slalom at Sea Otter. Kelley comes under the wing of 2016’s team leader and Enduro World Series (EWS) Champion Richie Rude, a five-year Yeti veteran racer who came on board at the age of 16 before taking the 2013 Junior DH World Champion title. Despite his young age, Rude’s experience and two world championships will prove valuable as the team continues to focus on enduro. #YetiCycles

"Nepal isn’t easy to get to and that’s part of the adventure. Fortunately, I would be met on the other end by the crew from H&I Adventures — all Yeti freaks and the world’s best mountain bike travel company. I would also be greeted by twenty-five Yeti riders, affectionately called the tribe, who had traveled from the US, UK, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Indonesia. It was truly humbling to spend our 30th Anniversary in Nepal with this diverse group of Yeti owners — I was incredibly stoked." Link in our profile to Nepal excursion.

As a mountain biker, there are moments that you don’t soon forget. It was the last day of our trip to Iceland riding and testing the SB4.5c and we were met with a cold rainy morning. Motivation was beginning to fizzle. We waited out the storm and as it subsided we were left with tacky trails, brisk air, and nothing but muddy grins on our faces as we made our way down the winding trail parallel to countless waterfalls, ending at the famed Skógafoss. A perfect ride to end yet another grand adventure on two wheels. #YetiCycles #ProvenHere #SB45c

Southwest. Proven Here.

The landscape of the American southwest is an ethereal place. The cathedral towers, deep canyons, and crushed red dirt produce terrain with endless riding possibilities. One is only limited by his efforts to push further. Pedaling along the sun drenched plateaus and in the shadowed canyons, all while sleeping below the stars in the cool night, you can start to feel displaced from the daily grind. That is until the beer runs low, the skins begins to redden and you head back to civilization to refuel. The deserts of the southwest are like a second home for many mountain bikers, providing a sanctuary in the winter months as an escape from whatever ails.

No matter where you started, from Burro Pass in the high elevations to the lower rim, it all ends here, spitting you out along miles of singletrack adjacent to the mighty Colorado River.

From the tangled sheep paths of the tussock grasslands to purpose-built trails snaking through the sharp mountain peaks, New Zealand ’s varied topography makes for an awe-inspiring mountain bike playground. We traveled throughout the South Island testing the SB5.5c on the fast, ragged conditions in Queenstown and Mount Cook to the mud and gnarled roots of the beach forests of Craigieburn. #YetiCycles #ProvenHere

Queenstown is the social and adventure hub of the south island. From grabbing lunch and chatting up the line, at the iconic Fergburger to swinging a few thousand feet off the ground on a bungy, it has it all covered. Littered throughout the hills above Queenstown in the Cornet and Moonlight peaks are trails, trails that make for exceptional riding.

The iconic Mt Cook is New Zealand's highest peak, knows as Aoraki to the native Maori people. While the destination is primarily known by adventure seekers for rock climbing, the steep paths hidden among the tussock grass provide for some untamed and challenging downhills runs. The hike back up the pitches forces one to take pause at the top, sometimes to catch your breath, but more so to enjoy the view after each successive ride down.

The high alpine areas of the Craigieburn region are covered in scrub and beech forests. The trees’ dense thicket of growth provides a canopy creating a wet and muddy playground.

The Yeti SB4.5c takes home one of three Editors' Choice awards from @bicyclingmag. Testers commented that the SB4.5c is "...an efficient climber, but the Switch Infinity suspension allows a tight wheelbase and a springy pop that let's you rail berms, boost airs... and basically forget you're on a short-travel 29er." @bicyclingmag also chose the SB5c and SB5c Beti as stand-outs. Read up on all of it on the @bicyclingmag website now and check it out in print in the July issue. #RideDriven #YetiCycles
Our trip to New Zealand was all about exploring the shear scope of the landscape and the fantastic riding it offers. With a small population and virtually no trail access issues, the riding is almost limitless. We imagine like it was 50 years ago in the U.S. We all agreed, the laid back NZ lifestyle grew on us. #YetiCycles #ProvenHere

Link to film in profile! - Three Yeti ambassadors and childhood friends @joeyschusler, @sam_seward, and @mason_lacy set out for the far western corner of Mongolia to combine mountain biking and packrafting in a self-supported adventure into the unknown. Aboard the #SB5c and the #SB45c, this would be their first attempt at a mountain bike to packraft link-up in one of the most remote and sparsely populated places in the world. Told in detail in the upcoming July issue of @bikemag, the adventure that ensued pushed the boundaries of comfort, but also of what they knew of human generosity, camaraderie and the spirit of adventure that connects us all. #FlashesOfTheAltai #YetiTribe
"The Kazakh nomads of Western Mongolia, move from place to place as the seasons, farming and hunting determine. They live in what we would call yurts - in their language "Gers" and they move them piece by piece, tapestry by tapestry on their horses and camels. As we rode by, locals would often invite us in, proud to show us their homes and share local delicacies like fermented mare's milk served along side stale sweets. We sat with the elders, ate and communicated as best we could. Of course, the kids would ride our bikes around outside and marvel at parts and components that looked so foreign to them. When we rode away, our lives stuffed into bikepacking bags it was clear to us how a simpler life can often bring the most happiness." - Yeti Ambassador @joeyschusler from #FlashesOfTheAltai, link to film in profile.

While the SB5.5c may have been born from racing, it’s reliability and performance transferred right over to this style of bikepacking adventure. Coupled with some Revelate Designs bikepacking bags, ENVE wheels, and fresh off the press SRAM Eagle drivetrain we were fully kitted to go light and fast to the best of our abilities.  Throughout the entire 11 days we were lucky enough to only experience one mechanical, an easy fix, a flat tire. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #SB55
What adventures will 2017 bring? Hopefully more like this, back in August riding the Knik Glacier in Alaska. Not a traditional mountain bike trail, but the idea that nobody had ridden this moraine before inspired @alexstrohl to capture the image. Once up top they were all amazed by the views, a mix of blue, grey and white ice in every direction. Five miles to the west lay the mouth of the glacier, as they pondered the time it would take to travel that distance in these rough conditions the wind picked up.

The San Juans are my backyard—and the ultimate playground for people seeking adventure, solitude, and scintillating singletrack. It was the perfect formula for a mountain biking and fly fishing exploit. @benjamin_kraushaar Yeti Ambassador.
The hills were steep, the rain relentless, and hike-a-bikes grueling. It was as if the mountains didn't want us there. With every labored pedal stroke forward, Mother Nature seemingly fought backward with equal might. For almost the whole trip, the weather was especially bad. Instead of Colorado’s typical powerful but short storms, we got pounded with chronic bad weather. For more on the High Altitude Lines excursion click link in bio. #YetiTribe #MoreThanMyth ⠀

We finally caught a break in the weather and made an early morning attempt at an unnamed, 13,000-foot pass that would eventually leads us to Silverton. There is something about predawn alpine starts that seems to intensify the sense of adventure. Maybe it's the cool air, or the rough transition from deep sleep to mouth breathing exertion. #YetiTribe #MoreThanMyth ⠀

I’m a big fan of tent chilling, but being cooped up with Sam for hours on end when I could be fishing a beautiful alpine lake, is a tough pill to swallow. Occasionally the boredom would reach unbearable levels, and we would attempt to fish in the cold rain.  We didn’t catch anything, but the feeling of casting a fly rod produces more euphoria than listening to Sam’s dumb stories and snores.  #YetiTribe #MoreThanMyth ⠀

Dreaming of Whistler... Every mountain biker at least once should go to Whistler and explore the park and the surrounding valley trails.

Both mountain biking and fly fishing ignite emotions of triumph and dismay. The frustration of fixing a flat in the rain closely parallels the feeling of untangling a line snagged in a tree. The thrill of sending a steep line draws similar feelings to those that arise from fighting a savage trout. But most importantly, both sports are a catalyst for adventure, excuses to get out and enjoy the glory of the mountains with your best friends. #YetiTribe #MoreThanMyth ⠀

Rain has become a staple on the EWS circuit this year and when racers awoke on Saturday morning to see the skies had opened up and mud and puddles riddled the pits, it seemed Mother Nature has dealt another interesting hand. Colorado dirt however, had other plans and while the early starters wrestled with slick conditions, the tracks had dried before the pros toed the line. With weeks of elevation prep under his belt and a hunger for a win, @richie_rude1 won the day despite crashes on stage 2 and 3. Tracks are dry for Sunday and stages 4-6 hold a few more technical challenges than what riders saw in the first three stages. With a 10-second lead, Richie is focused on taking it all the way home.

When the day started one might have predicated that Richie was poised for the overall win. So much can change in one day of racing. Fellow Yeti-Fox team riders @kellymtb , @shawnneer , and @jubaldavis  finished strong but @richie_rude1  had a flat and major off wrecking his chances for the day.

Moab is a second home to us in the spring and fall. Due to high temperatures, we rarely head that way in the summer. So while we're enjoying high alpine riding, we sometimes long for the red rock grippy trails of Utah.

Yeti Tribe is never meant to be clean, polished or perfect. In fact, quite the opposite. There are aspects we won’t compromise— a crushing ride aboard the best bikes in the world, good food and drinks, and impeccable company. But you can bet your bottom dollar you won’t find us in a hotel ballroom anytime soon. We embrace the grime and grit.⠀ ⠀

Some races feel less like a competition between riders and more like a competition between rider and trail. Such was the case for the Yeti Fox Factory Team over the weekend @world_enduro round 7 in Whistler. This year the race kicked off with the storied and highly technical Top of the World trail. Just over 7 km later, three of the seven Yeti riders had succumb to mechanicals or gnarly stack ups leaving either their bodies or bikes useless. Athletes @richie_rude1, @shawnneer in the pro-men category and @duncan_nason and @paulserra2204 in U21, would muster the strength and focus to charge on. Richie struggled to find his rhythm all day but by stages 4 and 5 it finally clicked. He took 3rd and 1st respectively. It wasn't, enough, however, to win the day and Richie ended up 12th.

With a newfound sense of motivation and energy, we dropped into what would be the most glorious section of trail on the trip. Our bikes bounced over loose volcanic rock, and our tires dug deep into the tacky soil. We blazed through a blur of wildflowers and sub alpine fir.

Last year, when we designed the SB5 with all-new geometry and design – we all thought it looked a lot like the old chum we knew and loved.

For @sarahvirginiauhl a freelance fine art and commercial artist, her work—and her play— stem from flow. It’s why her mountain biking and her painting go hand in hand. And why, when she packs for a road trip, she always throws in both her Yeti Beti and art supplies. From Carbondale, Colo., where Sarah lives, Crested Butte is the perfect getaway: a mere scenic three-hour drive away, buff singletrack, ample campsites, and arguably the densest stands of aspens in the state. ⠀⠀⠀⠀

The best way to describe Yeti’s design philosophy is with a quick view into our product meetings. Recently, we debated gear ratios and what front chainring size we should model our kinematics around. Scenarios were laid out from all angles. Climbing, descending, Apex, Nor Cal, Whistler and racing. It was spirited and took the better part of the afternoon.⠀ ⠀
Some would say we dive too deep into the minutia, but this is the ethos of Yeti. It isn’t a battle of egos. It’s about making sure we make the best riding mountain bikes. We have the luxury of making product decisions in a vacuum – no bean counters looking over our shoulders, no focus groups and nobody to answer to except the Tribe.⠀ ⠀
Once the decision is made, there is no second guessing. We easily move on with the comfort knowing that the collective scrutiny produced the right direction.⠀ ⠀
The 2018 bike line is not the result of a one or two-year development project. It is born from years of making tough product decisions. Chris and I know that perfection will forever be a moving target, yet we will always strive for it. We’re excited to present the new product line. Hope you enjoy it.⠀ ⠀

The smart car pulls away, Ross doubles over in laughter having thought the humble clown car was trying to offer a ride to three hitchhiking mountain bikers. To be fair, Ross had been splayed out on a concrete barrier looking like he was injured or the victim of a roadside exorcism. Bike upturned beside him, his posture of complete exhaustion would prove to be prophetic over the next five days, where we hoped for our thumbs to act as bus fare on a 500KM loop of the Southern Coast Range of BC.⠀

@richie_rude1 gets some practice time between the tape for the final stop of the @world_enduro series in Finale Ligure, Italy. The riding in Finale is hard to describe. The trails in the lower foothills are loose, rocky and exposed. Up high it is equally rocky, but some trails offer more traction, the corners are tight and there are plenty of trees that can grab handlebars. Overall, the riding is technical, challenging and unpredictable. The outcome is the appropriate setting to put the world's best riders to the ultimate and final test.

A paved road leads up Cypress mountain. A meniscus crushing, dehydration inducing, serpentine path of suffering that's well traveled by lycra wearing chumps, and tourist vehicles trying to gain perspective on the metropolis of Vancouver. It could be pedaled, but we could also ride the coattails of some unsuspecting tourist, so we wait instead. A sloth paced RV pulls into view, an awkwardly long amount of time passes as we look into the RV's windshield as it inches towards us up the hill. It stops, and moments later three bikes are getting crammed into the RV's walkway. Every pickup so far have been from Quebecois drivers. For some reason, they’ve been our saviors. I'm trying to make small talk with the family's two French speaking children, while Tobin banters away with the driving parents.⠀

Richie Rude won’t tell you many details about his run that locked down the Junior World Championship DH title for him in 2013.

Cochran's ski hill is not only a mountain famous for the Olympic skiers from which it gets its namesake, but also for being the source of one of Vermont's other famous exports - maple syrup. Throughout the fall, riders wind their way up and down the hills below a canopy of colorful leaves and a spiderweb of pale blue sap lines. With it taking nearly ten gallons of sap to yield just one quart of sweet golden syrup, you can bet those lines are flowing just as fast as the wheels below. ⠀

Established by gold miners, the long and steadily climbing trail passes through old mining sites and derelict ghost towns. The reward at the peak is a panoramic view of the rainforest below and a night’s stay at the Ghost Lake hut. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth Photos: @rossbellphoto

Yeti Cycles is thrilled to add Canadian three-time Olympian and all-around multi-talented @geoffkabush to the race roster for 2018. Kabush will focus on endurance, trail and stage race events for the season defending titles @bcbikerace, @transcascadia, and the Downieville Classic. As well as the dubious honor of undefeated arm wrestling champ at Blitz to Bend. Kabush is Yeti through and through and did we mention he can take a punch? Welcome to the Tribe, buddy. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth  Photos: @reubenkrabbe
The cold sucks, but so does not riding. We have to fight our instincts to set the bike aside and hibernate during the winter season. We could easily migrate south to avoid the inevitable. Or we could throw on a few more layers to explore deeper into the woods through a different lens. To fight off hibernation, Yeti Ambassadors @yetibetisarah and @reubenkrabbe head to Whistler B.C. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth

"I love going out several times a year when the weather is at its gnarliest. To experience a landscape when temperature or precip hit their hyperbole gives you an appreciation for how and why a location has its own character and identity. Until you’ve ridden through fog thick enough to chew on the coast, the Old Man’s Beard on the trees don’t mean nearly as much." - Yeti Ambassador, @reubenkrabbe on riding in the winter months. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth

Congratulations to Yeti Cycles Ambassador, guide, and three-time Nepali National MTB Champion @rjripper for being nominated as a @natgeo "Adventurer of the Year." Known as RJ Ripper to his friends and Yeti family, he first raced his country's national championship on a "franken-bike" he fabricated from old bike and motorcycle parts. He later caught the eye of a local bike racer, guide company owner, and distributor, @mandilpradhan. Mandil took RJ under his wing and along with help from the global mountain bike community and RJ's family, RJ became one of the fastest mountain bikers in Asia. Check out RJ's story by following the link in our bio. This June fellow Yeti Ambassador and filmmaker, @joeyschusler, will release a 20-minute film telling RJ's incredible story. This is just the beginning.

We call her Sally Rally, but she wears many hats - coach, pro racer, ambassador, counselor, business owner, leader, mentor, friend. @yetibetisarah came knocking on Yeti's door when she was fresh out of college. We hired her and she's been family since. Check out her write up in @eskapee by @sariebear_ie talking about mountain biking, of course, but touching on some of the more difficult parts of life and loss.

P: @davetrumporephoto
Conditions in Lo Barnechea, Chile couldn't be more opposite of those for @world_enduro Round 1 in Rotorua, New Zealand last year. Mud and wet roots were traded for the dubious "anti-grip" fine dirt of today's tracks. Loose and wild were the name of the game today. @richie_rude1 came out of the gate swinging for the 2018 season and took the stage wins on 1 and 3, but a crash and flat in stage 2 has Richie sitting in 124th for the day. Three more stages tomorrow. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
P: @davetrumporephoto
@duncan_nason goes into day 2 of racing in Chile sitting in first 14 seconds ahead of the U21 field. @shawnneer sits in 6th, well within podium-striking distance. Today holds another 34 km of riding, 1600 m of climbing and a bit more than 3000 m of descending. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
The dust has settled quite literally in Chile and Yeti /Fox U21 athlete @duncan_nason is sitting atop the podium. @richie_rude1 came out on the track ready to redeem his title, but a flat on stage 2 had other plans. @shawnneer put in his best Enduro World Series yet, finishing in 10th and teammate @jubaldavis put in a solid 35th place finish.

"The allure of loam and steep descents up north are what keep my thoughts churning at night. After the repetition of summer events, I crave the deafening silence of the damp forest.

This is what we can do with short travel and our newly configured Switch Infinity. It transcends the weight-weenie, uphill only models and replaces it with a precision riding bike. If some people assume it's a downhiller's XC bike, whatever… Call it what you want. For us, it's simply the bike we always wanted to build. The SB100. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth #NewBikeDay
Walk around the halls at Yeti and you’ll find women who can tear your legs off on the uphill and mock you on the downhill. The SB100 Beti quickly gained a reputation for its climbing ability and for how it descends. It's our genre-killing 100 mm trail machine, built for your next #ladyshred adventure. #YetiCycles #YetiBeti #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
P: @mdelormephoto
The SB100 is a strong XC climbing machine, but the gravity inspired geometry, 120mm @Fox 34 Step-Cast fork and meaty tires are all trail. The result is a perfect blend of pedaling efficiency with downhill prowess. It's the bike of choice for Yeti pro rider, @geoffkabush, as he defends his titles at the @BCBikeRace and Downieville Classic.

P: @craig_n_grant 
#YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MorethanMyth
For the SB100 and SB100 Beti, the look and layout of our Switch Infinity mechanism was changed to best work with our shorter travel 100mm platform. Switch Infinity utilizes a translating pivot point that allows us to tune the suspension kinematics to our desired characteristics. The SB100 Switch Infinity link is rotated 90 degrees to allow for slimmer, more efficient packaging and is lighter than the previous design. We worked with @Fox to independently test the mechanism for durability, and wear and tear in the harshest conditions - but shielded it with an easy to remove cover to keep the crud out. The SB100 Switch Infinity uses its own hardware but performs exactly like the original. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
Yeti pro rider @geoffkabush takes the win and defends his title @moabrocksmtb aboard the all-new SB100. Covering more than 75 miles and 9,500 feet of climbing, Kabush was rewarded with chunky, rocky descents that Moab serves up without fail. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth

"We'd dragged our good buddy, film-maker @joeyschusler, to the remote corner of southwest China to bikepack a high altitude circuit around three extraordinary mountains considered sacred by the Tibetan people. 
Known as the 'Yading Kora,' this multi-day pilgrimage beneath a triangle of snow-clad, 19,000-plus-foot peaks is a rite of passage for Tibetans. For these hardy plateau dwellers, a 'kor' - or completed circamambulation of mountains historically ordained as holy by various Dalai Lamas - will purify a lifetime of negative karma."

Betis - Beti Tribe Scotland is on. We want you, yes you - to join us. Colorado Beti @rgottfried joined us on our last International Beti Tribe Gathering in New Zealand. Here is what she had to say: "My @mountainbikeworldwide trip to New Zealand was my first experience on a guided trip, and it outlived my expectations in every way. I began the trip as an intermediate rider, slightly nervous about the riding difficulty and hours on the bike. It turned out everyone had the same nerves, and our guides worked with us to make sure the group started and ended the day with positive vibes, adjusting routes to account for our abilities and weather. I came home with stronger legs, more fitness, and a group of friends I now call family. The time and energy H&I put into this trip was evident— sign me up for the next adventure!" - Rachel Gottfried (Arvada, CO)

Yeti ambassador, racer and the man behind #FollowCamFriday, @natehills1 was one of the first ambassadors to order up a SB100. Since Nate mainly focuses on enduro racing and shredding the most technical trails he can sniff out, we were waiting with somewhat bated breath to see his final build. It did not disappoint. For all you #bikenerds out there, here is his SB100 spec run down. "I built my 100 for light enduro\ down country use. I am running @srammtb Eagle XX1, Guide Ultimate brakes 180mm front and rear. The fork is a 130mm Pike that slackens the bike to about 67 degrees. I slapped a 36T chainring for max output and 150mm reverb seat post. Current tires are @maxxistires 2.5 Minnion DHF, 2.3 Aggressor combo on Roval Traverse SL Carbon 31mm id wheels. Final details are a 750mm wide bars, 50mm stem, MRP 1X chainguide and @ergonbike GD1 grips and saddle." Nate took this rig to Moab @endurocupmtb and placed second. We think that speaks for itself. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
"Mountain biking is a part of my soul. Life is all about mountain biking for me. No other job has given me what mountain biking has." He is @rjripper.

See @joeyschusler's most recent creation #RJRipperFilm at Yeti Cycles headquarters in Golden, Colo. this Wednesday, June 20th. Follow the link in our bio to purchase tickets and for more info. All proceeds go to benefit RJ's race fund and visa bid. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
Rajesh Magar learned from a young age that life wasn't always going to be easy. His mom noted that he understood his "circumstances at an early age. So, he started doing little odd jobs and saved up for months to buy a bicycle." That very bicycle was later seen as a distraction and sold, but that still didn't deter RJ. After all, he would come to be known as @rjripper. Nepal's fastest mountain biker, RJ is the subject of @joeyschusler's newest feature #RJRipperFilm. Come see it on the big screen as well as a few other of Joey's edits this Wednesday, June 20th at Yeti Cycles HQ in Golden, CO.

True to its reputation, the @world_enduro is dishing up wet conditions for its fourth installment of the season. With some of the longest stages in EWS history spanning the border between Austria and Slovenia, it will be a very physical race— steep trails, tight switchbacks, and a ridiculous amount of roots. If the weather brightens, conditions will be all-time. If the rain continues, the deathly slick roots and limestone will become treacherous.

The game makers were hard at work this weekend for Round 4 of the EWS in Austria and Slovenia and served up as promised, one of the most challenging stops in the history of the series. After 96.5 km (59.6 miles), 2,732 meters (8,963 feet) of climbing and  5,026 meters (16,489 feet) of descending over two days and two countries, the best riders in the world were worse for the wear. Sprained ankles, broken thumbs (@jubaldavis - heal up quick friend) and plenty of OTBs were tallied. At the end of day, @richie_rude1 and @shawnneer finished in mostly one piece 21st and 28th, respectively. We'll dust ourselves off and set sights for Round 5.

@richie_rude1 and @duncan_nason went one, two yesterday topping the Pro Men's podium at the third stop of the @bigmountainenduro series @keystone_resort. As is par for the course at Keystone, it was dry, dusty and loose. Familiar territory for Richie, his race plan for the weekend was to stay on @world_enduro pace - as such he put about a minute on his teammate by day's end. Stage 4 proved to be the most technical, but Richie made quick and tidy work of it, putting 20 seconds into his competition on that stage alone. Yeti Devo rider @lmbmtb also put in a solid effort for the day coming in 4th on the Pro Women's podium.

In the northwest corner of Italy beneath the shadow of Mont Blanc lies the Aosta Valley.

When you throw a leg over the all-new SB150, you'll find it rides strikingly similar to nothing. It rides bigger, climbs better and is difficult to put into a neat little box. Some may say it's too slack, too low, too long, too different just to say so. That’s fine. The SB150 isn’t for everyone. But riders who push this bike quickly become accustomed to their newfound capability. Learn more by following the link in our bio. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth #SB150

.
“No matter if you're casually pedaling or mashing on the cranks, railing berms or bashing the rough bits, the bike maintains a very calm, quiet feel the entire time. It's this trait that makes it possible to find your personal flow state faster and really jive with the bike and terrain."

We learned today that former Yeti racer @jaredgravesmtb has a brain tumor. He’s a legend by any definition. He has multiple world champion titles, represented Australia in the Olympics, and one of the most talented bike riders. Ever. And, he’s one of the most down-to-earth, friendly, professional racers you’ll ever meet. We’re proud to call him part of the Yeti family and want to send out good vibes and a speedy recovery as he heads into surgery.
Lab and track tested to downhill standards, the SB6 has the most stage wins of any EWS bike to date and is built to take a beating. New for 2019, we’ve added tunneled internal tubes for easier service in the pits. The @Fox 36, 170mm spec’d fork with a 37 mm offset ensures this bike is uniquely suited for taking on big terrain.

One bike can’t rule them all, but the SB130 is one bike that rules.

One bike that rules - SB130.

Yeti's proven Switch Infinity suspension is improved with new kinematics and more progressive geometry. The 77-degree seat tube angle and big wheels make it an unapologetic climber. Slightly shorter chainstays, slack headtube angle, long reach and a 44 mm offset fork ensures it’s flick-able and playful, but still rages on the downhill. Follow the link in our bio to learn more.

Yeti Pro Ambassador and #FollowCamFriday curator @natehills1 brings his new SB130 into the wild. “The SB130 is amazingly stable at speed - like, DH bike stable. For how long it feels initially, the rear end is short and still lets the bike feel playful. The low BB feels so sick in turns and the 77-degree seattube angle is amazing. After riding this bike, I realized I had been sitting on the tip of my saddle during climbs for years. Never have I experienced a bike that climbs well, feels stable going fast and can still turn on a dime.” #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth #SB130

“There was a time, not that long ago, when you'd pick between either a cross-country bike or a downhill bike and that was mostly it. Nowadays, you could argue that there are at least four or five distinct categories, and then there are the bikes that blur the lines a bit. The SB100 is one of those niche bikes, but its capabilities are far from niche; it'll feel like an extremely capable cross-country bike to some, and an efficient, sharp-handling trail bike to others.” @pinkbike's Mike Levy reviews the #SB100.

“Yeti’s bikes have always looked amazing but the new SB150 is different animal. With 150mm travel on the rear, combined with a 170mm fork and a slack 64.3degree head angle, this modern 29er enduro bike is an absolute weapon on the descents, yet you can still beast everyone on the climbs.

On a 10-day, self-supported navigation around three sacred 19,000-foot-plus peaks in southwest China and Tibet, the three adventurers would aim to complete what is known as the "Yading Kora" and purify a lifetime of negative karma.

Yeti ambassador @annegalyean loves getting rowdy on her SB100 Beti. And so do the editors @bicyclingmag. The publication named the bike Gear of the Year.
“...The result is a women’s ‘XC’ bike that can rally rowdy descents and scamper up climbs. It will make you fall asleep at night thinking, ‘I can’t wait to ride my bike tomorrow.’”

@yeticycles ambassador @joeyschusler seems to always be on an adventure or planning one. Once a factory race team athlete, planning is in Joey’s DNA. He attended his own school of hard knocks and every trip offers its own lessons and successes. Here is Joey’s advice to anyone taking on their first bike adventure: “The first and most important step is to commit 100% to going. Make the time, pick the route, and go. Finding a good route can be challenging, but scouring blogs, picking friends brains, searching maps, and obsessing over Google Earth until you find the route you are looking for usually does the trick. There are trails everywhere, and some great resources online for planning.”
.
“The next step is to figure out what gear is best for you, and best for the adventure at hand. Asking the right questions helps to dial in your adventure and make sure you are prepared. Will you be camping? Will it be cold? Hot? What are your water sources? Are these good sources? Are there any huts or towns along the way? How many days do you want to go for? How much food will you need? What gear can you bail on?”
.
“Ask yourself any and all questions you can muster, and hopefully you’ll be prepared enough. The best way to figure out your adventure planning though is previous experience. Every trip and adventure you go on, learn from it, figure out what worked best, and build off that on your next adventure. That’s really the best way to dial things in.” #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth

Jason got his first mountain bike when he was 12, purchased with lawn mowing money and a little assistance from his dad. Since that day, he's worked tirelessly to preserve singletrack as he saw his favorite So Cal trails overtaken by tract housing and strip malls. In his role as a photographer and director @zangsfilms, Jason tells the stories of people and places preserving open space. . "It is my belief that the collective voice of the mountain bike community and the economic potential of mountain biking can be effectively leveraged to advocate for more open space and more trails.

With all the uncertainty in the world, there are some things that remain constant. We’ve spent the last 35 years surrounded by a world-class crew we refer to as the Yeti Tribe. They’ve gotten us through epic rides after we’ve cracked and struggled to get home, we’ve shared more than few beers and they’ve provided friendship in good times and bad.

We all need a Tribe now. We all need to have each other’s back. We encourage everyone to stay safe, be sensible, and power on. We’re up for the challenge. We’re mountain bikers, after all.

“Ten times a day I get asked, 'Which Yeti Should I buy?' and I always struggle to answer.

Everyone is looking for that elusive unicorn bike — one that climbs like an XC rig and descends like a downhill bike. But I think we can all agree that this unicorn will never actually exist. That said, this is the closest thing I have found that lets me experience big days on technical terrain while not having to hold back one bit on the descents. The SB130LR is my idea of the perfect trail bike. It’s got the proper geometry and a perfect blend of efficiency and capability for the terrain I enjoy riding most. The coil out back just adds to the party.

My everyday smash wagon. SB130LR.” - @natehills1

Since much of our ability, and freedom to ride, race, and connect outdoors has been quelled, we’re now challenged to keep our stoke for mountain biking alive in different ways.

A crew of three set out to cover as much downhill ground possible without having much of a solid plan. Transportation hinged on fabled Canadian kindness getting strangers from point A to point B with bikes and gear in tow. “Our trio wasn't trying to prove anything, this carless yet car-dependent exercise-in-exercise wasn't meant to be an altruistic venture to dodge our carbon conscience. If anything, it was a strategic variant on friends' similar trips. They had pedaled every mile of asphalt in between and cherry picked singletrack. In our minds, that sounded like type-two fun. We wanted to use our saddle-sore budget on climbing and descending so we could enjoy the hour-plus descent on Jack The Ripper.

By no means is this an epiphany, it's one of those simple things that is hard to keep in mind. Adventure isn't exclusively hidden beyond the reach of the last cell tower, it's also subtly hidden inside common spaces, where it can be found by choosing a new perspective on the things we think we know.” - Reuben Krabbe

Health care workers have always taken care of us. Patching riders up countless times since 1985. So in an effort to give back and help the heroes on the front lines, we’ve temporarily refocused our production efforts to making PPE shields that help to extend the safe use of an N95 mask. Production began on Saturday and we’re ramping up to produce 1,000 shields a day. Thank you @smithoptics @blackdiamond  @uwmadison and @vcgraphix_ for the help.

We need your help getting in touch with those in need in Colorado. If you are a healthcare worker or first responder, please email us at donations@yeticycles.com. Or if you know someone in need, please share this post with them. Link in bio for more info.

It’s not surprising, but everyone we contacted wanted to help and their help was critical in this coming together so quickly.” - Steve Hoogendoorn

This is a group effort made possible by our hardworking employees, industry friends at @smithoptics @blackdiamond  and @vcgraphix_ , and the community working to spread the word.

It’s our responsibility to step up to support our friends and neighbors when they need it most. When this is all over, we can show our gratitude over a cold one. Until then, let’s keep our frontline and health care providers protected.

With several miles and many races logged on his SB100, Yeti Ambassador @leejonathan_ writes his long term review. Check it out. “My favorite bike of all time, the @yeticycles #SB100. I’ve had two years refining this platform, and I’ve learned a lot along the way.

1. The rear end on this bike is so good that it’s hard to find a fork to match. It’s been tricky for me to get the SC34 to match like I wanted, but the @mrpbike Ribbon SL is a darn near perfect match. Initially supple but somehow supportive, a stable platform, and very progressive.

2. I up’d my spring rate in the rear with the fork change and am running 171psi as a result. It removes a hair of the initial suppleness, but makes the bike incredibly composed when you are on the gas.

3. This bike likes responds increasingly favorably as rider input progresses, even in the gnarliest terrain. In other words, take control of this thing, slap berms, send drops and go for the risky line with confidence – it’ll reward you.

This bike is the only one that gives me #newbikeday feels every time I ride it, and I can’t wait to build up my 2020 and test out a couple changes. Cheers to race bikes, cheers to short travel and big wheels, and cheers to the bike your XC bike warned you about.” - Jonathan Lee

The oddities: Only a rear brake (SRAM G2) because it won't be doing much downhill. Rigid carbon seatpost trimmed to 6" long, for light weight and minimalism. 7-speed SRAM drivetrain, since I don't plan to climb much and am hoping a short-cage derailleur will be lighter/stronger. The derailleur is run by a mini, modified GripShift, because I don’t want the shifter triggers getting stuck in my belt or pockets on tuck no-handers. To shift I use just the flange and otherwise have a full lock-on grip for normal riding.

When Yeti Cycles started thirty-five years ago, the founders felt strongly about building a community that was founded on racing and the belief that mountain bikes make us better people. We shared this with our friends at the races, at festivals and ultimately at Yeti Tribe Gatherings, where hundreds gather each year to ride epic trails, and enjoy the camaraderie of post ride beers and stories together.

We’ve referred to this crew as the Yeti Tribe – a community of people who love to ride mountain bikes. The notion of tribe was appealing to us because it was community-centric, familial, and had strong social values.

Recently, we’ve learned our use of the term “Tribe” can be offensive to indigenous people, due to the violent history they have endured in the United States.  The word “Tribe” is a colonial construct that was used to marginalize Native Americans and its continued use by non-Indigenous People fails to accurately recognize their history and unique status as Tribal Nations.

After discussion with members of the indigenous community, studying accurate representations of our shared history, and reflecting on our values as a company, Yeti Cycles has decided we will no longer use the term “Tribe” in our marketing.

The community we have built will move forward and thrive. Yeti Gatherings will continue to be our most valued events of the year. We have walked away from a word, but the soul of our community remains intact. We ask you all to join us in embracing this change.

Thanks to the mountain bike community for your guidance and especially to the members of the Indigenous community for educating us on this issue.

See you on the trail.

“With not much going on this summer, we’ve been trying to stay as busy as we can. I called Nic up randomly one afternoon and asked if he wanted to check out this little freeride zone in central Utah. A couple of days later, we found ourselves out there with a couple bikes, cameras, and camping supplies. We hiked a couple of faces before the sun went down, made some questionable food, camped under the stars, and woke up at sunrise to do the same thing before it reached 100 degrees.

“My bike set up is fairly simple for everything I need it to do. It leans more on the gravity side of things but works extremely well for pedaling and long transfers. People always comment on my bars, but I like them pretty narrow for control, comfort, and to squeeze through trees. I don't change my setup, so I'm always used to it and am never surprised by anything in sketchy situations. I also run my suspension really fast, not totally sure why, but that's how I like it. I use my SB150 for everything because I really believe it's the most versatile bike out there! “ - @warrenkniss

The second and last race of the 2020 season is underway. Winter Park was well suited to it’s name - the area was hit by a unexpected storm blanketing the mountain with snow and wind, making riding conditions today extra spicy.

Unfortunately the mixed track conditions got the best of @quinnreece, he will sit out the week due to an injury. The rest of the Yeti / @fox Factory Team is looking forward to a better forecast and primo conditions this weekend 

Stay tuned to see how @bigmountainenduro Winter Park unfolds.

Conditions were prime and the tracks were firing. Day two of practice at the @bigmountainenduro was more like one would expect.  Yesterday’s conditions made it almost a write-off.

The Yeti / @fox Factory team is no stranger to laying down fast times at Trestle, @richie_rude1 has won multiple BME’s and a national championship title at this venue. After a less than stellar result at Big Sky, Richie is looking forward to get back to the familiar venue and his winning ways.

“I have been riding with Kasper quite a bit. Taking laps and chasing each other has been really fun, but I always wanna win. I’m here to ride smooth, not make any mistakes and push myself as hard as I can” - Richie Rude

There would be no phoning this one in. @kasper_woolley and @richie_rude1 battled it out stage after stage and Woolley, once again, would prove he is relentlessly fast, claiming the overall win from Richie Rude by over five seconds.

Together with @ridefoxbike, @pinkbike, and @santacruzbicycles, we have committed to collectively raise $500,000 to benefit @growcyclingfoundation.

Grow Cycling Foundation is focused on making cycling more accessible and provide opportunities that haven’t been there before. The keystone of Grow Cycling Foundation will be a new pump track in a diverse area of Los Angeles. The pump track will serve as a community fixture that exposes people to the love for biking, as well as create cycling-centric pathways for career and life development.

To kick off support for this amazing program, Grow Cycling / Yeti / FOX SB150 Giveaway Sweepstakes will be giving out a fully decked out SB150. And we mean decked out: new Fox 38 fork and Float X2 shock, @rideshimano XTR drivetrain, and all the other bells and whistles you could want.

Yeti and FOX products are donated and all proceeds of the Yeti x FOX Giveaway Sweepstakes go to benefit the Grow Cycling Foundation.

Yeti Ambassador @leejonathan_ is methodical about his builds. His #SB130 is no different.

“The SB130 is my favorite mountain bike I’ve ever owned, and I’ve built it up in a way to allow it to be super versatile. It’s the perfect middle-ground bike. This bike weighs 28.6 lbs (12.9kgs) with these tires and drops all the way down to 27 lbs with the trail tire setup. Since this isn’t my XC race bike, weight is not a priority – ride quality and fun are the focus points on this trail bike.”

Dan Milner reimagines what can be done out his back door.

“When your world gets turned upside down, you have to reach for self-righting mechanisms; and when my plans as a global-travel photographer got put by the pandemic-shaped wayside, I knew I still needed a taste of adventure in my life — I’d just have to find it locally instead. Think global, act local, right? I rode from my backdoor, pedaling, then pushing, and finally shouldering my #SB140 to the top of the nearest peak, 4600 ft above home, where I knew, even between lockdowns, I’d find no-one else. Alone for a night, surrounded by huge vistas and a vast starry sky, I had the chance to find some context in the strange and challenging world that had suddenly fallen on us, reconnecting with the dirt, the rocks, and the damp grass around my bivouac and refocussing on life skills at their simplest level; brewing tea and listening out for wolves.

It was just one night. But it was one night when I had certainty in 10 months of chaos, and I’m thankful for that. All it took was some lateral thinking, some sweat, and a bike.” - @danmilnerphoto

Yeti Ambassador, Max Fierek tested positive for Lyme disease when he was nine years old, since then he has fought fatigue, lung capacity, muscle fatigue, short term memory loss and mood swings. For @mtbfierek, living with Lyme disease for half his life has taught him empathy for others and to cherish his time outside in nature which helps him stay positive and fight for his love of mountain biking.

Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia Burgdorferi. If lyme disease isn’t treated promptly or effectively symptoms can last weeks, months or even years after the tick bite.

For more information about how to prevent and treat Lyme disease, visit @lymetimes.

A typical year for Yeti / @fox Factory Team athlete, Shawn Neer consists of 6 months of traveling the world racing on some of the most physically and mentally daunting tracks the @world_enduro has to offer. Shawn has taken to his backyard trails in absence of his usual international racing schedule. Repetition breeds muscle memory and speed that toes the line between fast as hell and dangerous.

"As much of a bummer covid turned out to be in 2020. The silver lining turned out to be heaps more time training on local trails for race prep. I have never felt better on my bike and couldn't be more excited to get between the tape again. Bring on the race nerves and adrenaline.

Every now and then, someone passes through your life and their positive energy is so strong that everyone around them is affected. Sam Schneider, a Yeti staffer, was that guy. He was stoked on life and mountain biking above all else. No matter the situation, he always found the sliver of positivity (or even the whole slice) embraced it, and spent his 20 years making everyone around him smile. We’d all benefit from taking a page from Sam’s book. 

Sam lost his battle with cancer earlier this week, and we’re still trying to wrap our heads around it. We’ll remember his kind spirit, his infectious smile, and we know he’s shredding heavenly trails. Rest in Peace, Sam. You will be missed.

“Winning is core to Yeti, that much is clear. But to truly be a Yeti racer, you need to be more than that. Yeti racers have to have the right attitude, they have to be a part of the support system and they need to want to be part of a team. While mountain biking may be a solo sport, racing at this level means looking beyond individual performance — sharing line choices and cornering techniques. Fully supporting one another, ready and willing with a smile and a fist bump, no matter what happens out on the course.” - James Stokoe

Stay tuned as the Yeti / FOX Team competes in their first enduro of the year on Sunday. And watch as Rude pilots a DH #SB165 in the downhill event on Saturday.

A slick practice day for the Yeti / @fox Team at @windrockbikepark.

@richie_rude1 @shawnneer @quinnreece @warrenkniss 
#YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven
Time to shake off the nerves - the Yeti / @FOX race team is out in force at @windrockbikepark for the Tennessee National. The weather has held steady all week; then rain rolled in moments before Rude’s seeding run - instantly turning the top layer of dust into clay.

@richie_rude1 exercised caution, accepting an earlier start over the risk that the slick course posed, landing him 14th during seeding.

Following today’s practice, @richie_rude1, @shawnneer, @jubaldavis, @quinnreece, and @warrenkniss will get their final practice day in tomorrow before the three-stage enduro on Sunday.

Stay tuned to see how the boys fare in the Tennessee mud.

The path of a Yeti factory supported athlete is tried and true, and proven across disciplines with world titles in DH, 4x, and Enduro. 

Introducing the Yeti / OneUp Pro Team - a freshly minted team comprised of Australian legend, Jared Graves and breakout Squamish native and teammate, Kasper Woolley.

Although the pair are 10,000 miles apart, they’ve been gearing up for a fully booked 2021 race season – Crankworx, EWS, Trans BC, and XCO just to name a few. @jaredgravesmtb and @kasper_woolley will race together for the first time at the first round of the @world_enduro in Italy.

The Yeti / @oneupcomponents Pro Team has the deck stacked with combination of heritage, pedigree, raw talent and skill to an almost unfair degree. The pair is driven and hungry for results. Tune in this season as races are almost underway.

Rude claims the first win of the season by just under half a second at the first of the two EWS events week in Canazei, Italy. Yeti / @FOX Factory teammate, @shawnneer felt fast and was happy with his track speed in the beginning of the day, but stage four proved difficult and ended the day with a couple crashes. Neer placed 25th overall. Still amongst some fast company

Yeti / OneUp Pro Team rider, @kasper_woolley is one week post getting the all clear for riding. His aimed for smooth, clean runs, and he did exactly that. Woolley placed 47th overall, but stands only to gain strength and speed throughout the season.

One race down, one to go of the Val di Fassa double header. With a brand new racing format for 2021, the second event, only three days away, is still up for grabs and is anyones game.

@richie_rude1 claimed the top spot at EWS.3 La Thuile yesterday despite less than ideal conditions for stage three and four when the rain set in, winning stages one, two, and four (QS).

@kasper_woolley made the leap into the top ten, finishing 7th overall. A week of training and suspension testing in Finale, Italy, was exactly what Woolley needed to get back up to speed.

Yeti / @FOX Factory teammate, @shawnneer had an off race, crediting his lack of wet training time. Knowing what he needs to improve, he is looking forward to his chance for redemption in La Thuile.

@richie_rude1 wins the second Pro Stage of the @world_enduro in La Thuile, earning himself those coveted bonus points. Yeti / @FOX teammate, @shawnneer and Yeti / @oneupcomponents Pro Team rider, @kasper_woolley placed 14th and 33rd, respectively.

“You can kind of let it go a bit quicker than you would do on a normal (EWS) day because that is all you have to worry about.” - Richie Rude

Tune in tomorrow as the rest of the race unfolds.

What a race. The rain came in overnight, making the gravity heavy course harder to read with variable trail conditions and patchy light. 

@richie_rude1 left it all between the tape in the second half of the La Thuile doubleheader. He maintained the lead he earned in yesterday’s Pro Stage until Stage Four. Despite a P11 on S4, Rude ended the day strong and on the podium once again with a second-place finish.

@kasper_woolley finished the day 13th, and @shawnneer placed 94th after a fall on Stage Three that changed the course of his day.

Full race report Monday.

As the first @world_enduro block wraps up, @richie_rude1 holds on to the yellow race plate as the Series Leader by just five points over Moir. With such a slim margin, no one can afford to let off the gas. Racing is won or lost in the off-season – or in this case, the eight weeks between race blocks.

The Yeti / @FOX Devo Team arrived in Winter Park with high hopes of claiming the National Championship jersey. Unfortunately, that goal was out of reach. @warrenkniss placed 5th, while teammates @lauren_bingham_ and @quinnreece were injured and unable to race.

We're bummed that a scheduling conflict with the @world_enduro meant Rude, and Neer could not make a bid for the sleeve, but there’s always next year.

Last year was a breakout year for @kasper_woolley, beating some of the biggest names in Enduro racing, and to us, that’s not a surprise. Woolley’s bred from a pedigree of fast (his dad was on the National Ski Team), and Kasper competitively raced on the cold white stuff for years before focusing on biking. Who said the multi-sport athlete is dead? We didn’t. In this episode, Marty and Kasper talk everything from bike setup, skiing and how Kasper has always been fighting more than just the clock.

Daily rains have made practice days highly variable with muddy, slick morning laps followed by the dry, loose terrain that Big Sky is known for.

The first four stages kick off tomorrow, with 4,015 ft of climbing and 4,132 ft of descent. Tune in tomorrow to see how day one unfolds. It’s bound to be fast and loose.

Her love for the sport seeps through every part of her day, the multiple organizations she supports, and dozens of women she coaches and mentors. In this episode of TYTM @martyschaffer and @brittdgreer discuss her passion for bringing mountain bikes to underserved communities, where coaching has lead her, and the multitude of great “Front Country” (thanks, Marty) trails to learn on.

With the Yeti / @FOX Factory Team in transit to Europe, it’s the Nat / Devo Team’s turn to shine. @quinnreece , @warrenkniss , and @lauren_bingham_ have put in two solid days of practice and are ready to take on the steep, loose tracks that Purgatory is serving up. Equal parts techy descent and soul-crushing transfers mean that endurance will play a large role in determining success throughout the weekend.

Stages one - four are on deck for tomorrow, with stages five and six on Sunday. This is looking to be one of the rowdiest @bigmountainenduro stops this year, be sure to tune in tomorrow to see how it all unfolds.

Day one held a mix of flow trail and huge drops.

It’s about time.

While the name of the game is speed, we took our time to craft an e-MTB worthy of our race and brand heritage. Half a decade worth of development later, and the world’s first race-specific e-MTB is born.

Meet the 160E.

#YetiCycles #160E #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
With just 140 points separating @richie_rude1 and Jack heading into round seven, a win here was crucial to remain in contention for the overall series title.

Rude understood the assignment. He took the Pro Stage win and maintained his first place standing throughout the entire race – taking home the maximum points available and reclaiming the series lead. Teammate, @shawnneer had a few top ten finishes between the EWS and EWS-E, proving his track speed is there.

Yeti / OneUp Pro Team’s @kasper_woolley continued to push his pace. Feeling at home on the steep, rooty terrain, he took fourth-place finish on the Pro Stage and continued the momentum on Stage Two with a P5. “I felt like I was riding really well, but just had a few weird, little slip ups. Happy to still hold onto sixth with three crashes today.”

The Yeti team has raced Finale Ligure many times over, but the brand new Pro Stage proved to be a challenge for nearly the entire field. The raw, brand new track was steep with super-tight back-to-back switchbacks and jank nearly everywhere. With nothing yet burned in, line choice was paramount

“Long day in the saddle today, our first kind of big pedal weekend. But yeah, a little bit off the pace today – kind of annoying. I felt really good, just wasn’t on the pointy end I guess. I got fired up for the last stage and got second on that with some good points going into the final race. I gotta go for the win in Scotland. Treat it like any other race, just be confident and put down a good one.” - Richie Rude. He finished the weekend in 5th overall.

Trailing by just 70 points, you can bet that Rude will leave it all on the dirt as he chases down the title with everything he’s got.

One of the closes title chases in EWS history came to an anticlimactic end today at EWS.9 Tweed Valley. We are absolutely gutted about the season-ending UCI ruling regarding @richie_rude1’s Pro Stage run.

Yeti / @FOX teammate @shawnneer and @kasper_woolley placed 25th and 21st respectively in today’s Pro Stage and are ready for four more stages of rain, mud, and slick roots tomorrow.

Rude claims 2nd overall for the 2021 @world_enduro season despite being unable to compete in the final round. “There was some confusion on the bottom of the Pro Stage regarding gates and tape and I unfortunately got the shit end of the stick when I decided to go around one of them and I shouldn’t have. The ol’ commissaires decided to throw me a DQ and cut my weekend short and any chances of going for the overall win. Yeah, so that was a bit of a bummer for sure. I couldn’t be happier having this season and how it went.” - @richie_rude1

@kasper_woolley clinched yet another top-ten finish, taking 7th on the day and 12th overall.  Don’t let Kappy’s casual and slightly sarcastic race day demeanor fool you. Woolley is a weapon on the bike and a name to watch in 2022.

@shawnneer had a big week on the pedals between the EWS and EWS-E. “I am really jiving with the 160E. It would be nice we had a day off in between the races, but its time on the bike and it’s what we love to do.” Neer placed 12th in the EWS-E with top-ten finishes in 7 of 14 stages, and 43rd in the EWS.

And with that, the 2021 race season is over. We’d like to extend a massive thank you to our sponsors and everyone who helps make our race program what it is.

Reed Boggs is joining the party in the desert next week for @redbull Rampage. Let’s bring the heat, Boggs 🔥🤘

“Moments after teeing up my biggest flip yet, I got the call that I’m in Rampage.. so happy to say the least! LETS DO THIS SHIT!!” 💫🤘🏼 - @reedboggs

Durango holds a special place in Yeti’s heritage, so it’s fitting that the resurrection and return of the event should be in Durango as well. The spirit of the San Juan’s, built by the gold rush and maintained by an ongoing optimism and love for the outdoors, keeps Durango special. It’s the perfect spot for us Yeti Freaks to gather, find common ground and remind each other that the brand is about the people, not just the bikes. 

In this episode of TYTM, @martyschaffer chats with a few of the people who make The Gathering the event that it is.

Vision quest inspired. @reedboggs custom painted SB165 is Rampage Ready.

One more day of building and practice until the big event on Friday. 

“The first day of scope day, everyone was running to the left and I was just like, ‘well, I’m going to the right. There’s not much real estate to the left, so I took the lookers right ridge and I have my own line from top to bottom.”

Tune in to @redbull TV to watch it all unfold. Link in bio.

“I went out of my comfort zone to be prepared for this Rampage. I feel like I’m ready for this - it’s everything I have been practicing and working toward. Everybody is hungry, everybody has a really sick line and wants to do well. It is going to come down to who looks like they are having the most fun. And I think that’s going to be me.” - @reedboggs

@reedboggs set out to prove he belongs at @redbull Rampage, and he did just that.

Boggs earned his first Rampage podium last Friday, claiming third place. We couldn’t be more stoked for him.

Congrats, Reed 🤘

Full report Monday.

P: @josh__conroy 
#YetiCycles #MoreThanMyth #RedBullRampage
After blowing a tire on his first run, @reedboggs knew exactly what he needed to do for his second attempt. Boggs cleaned his second run with confidence, style, and ease – nailing every drop and trick he set out to attempt. He knew it, and so did the judges. That run earned him his first ever Rampage podium, claiming third overall amongst some of the biggest legends in freeride.

Boggs is no longer a name that you will find on the alternate list. After this past weekend, Reed has officially arrived.

“This year is a statement. I just want to prove to these guys that I deserve to be in the mix.”

Tune in Thursday, Oct. 28 to learn more about one of our biggest development projects in Yeti history.
 
The Learning Episode 01
#YetiCycles #RideDriven
It took time to make time. 
From the first alloy mule, to the final product you see today, the 160E is over five years in the making. The 160E is the brainchild of Stretch and our entire Engineering and Product teams; and Jared Graves. Olympian and two time world champion - a sommelier of bikes. 
Creating a new bike from scratch is a long, arduous process. But one done out of our commitment to racing and development. 
Introducing The Learning: EP.01. 
Watch the full episode. Link in bio.

#YetiCycles #160E #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
Racing is the reason.

The reason we spent over five years meticulously obsessing over pivot points, geometry, shock tunes, and a new 6-bar linkage system.

The Learning: EP.01.

“My #SB130 is built up from scratch for the conditions on my favorite trails in Squamish. I’m borderline on Yeti sizing but like the Large SB130 for the more technical and tight trails. The Lunch Ride option with extra travel and the X2 rear shock to tilt it more towards the gravity side. DoubleDown @maxxisbike tires F/R to keep up with it’s capability and full @rideshimano for reliability up North. A few orange touches with the @oneupcomponents chainguide and custom Lizard Skins grips make the bike special to me.” - @geoffkabush

Boggs signed with us at the beginning of 2020 - a leap for Yeti as we had not yet been tested at the top of the freeride scene.

Two years and a Red Bull Rampage Podium later, we could not be more excited and proud to announce our continued partnership for the next three years.

Cheers, Reed. Stoked to see what 2022 brings.
