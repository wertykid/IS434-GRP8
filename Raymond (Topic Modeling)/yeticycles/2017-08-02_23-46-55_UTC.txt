Moab is a second home to us in the spring and fall. Due to high temperatures, we rarely head that way in the summer. So while we're enjoying high alpine riding, we sometimes long for the red rock grippy trails of Utah. We know that soon enough we'll be back in the desert riding Captain Ahab, camping at Sand Flats Road and enjoying a well deserved milkshake at Milt's. #YetiCycles #YetiBeti #MoreThanMyth P: @joeyschusler
