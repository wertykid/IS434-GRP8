The Caucasus Mountains are the real deal. They are known as Europe’s highest peaks, towering in altitude above the Alps. This rugged range is located on the border with Georgia and Russia, at the nexus of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The region has a rich and troubled history, filled with violence, war, and hardship. We found nothing but gorgeous and vast empty landscapes; It’s hard to image this place as anything but peaceful and serene.
