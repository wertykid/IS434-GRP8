Four starts, four wins. When @richie_rude1 toes the line with the SB150 it is an unstoppable and undefeated combination. With @world_enduro Round 8 in Finale, Italy in the books, Richie is the first Mens Pro in EWS history to win every stage and of course, take home the win for the day. What a way to end the season.
