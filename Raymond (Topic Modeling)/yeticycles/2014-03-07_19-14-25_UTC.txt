When we first started planning our weeklong backcountry bike-packing trip to Peru, bringing the newly redesigned Yeti 575 was the natural choice. The adventure would be self supported in some of the most rugged mountains in the world, the Huayhuash Range tucked high up in the Peruvian Andes, and what we needed most in a bike was reliability. With a simplistic design and a durable aluminum chassis, the 575 held up to the test as we managed to navigate the demanding terrain without a single mechanical. What the bike lacks in high-tech features and carbon fiber proved to be its greatest assets. Stay tuned to see the entire photo feature and film from @joeyschusler & @thomaswoodson dropping online at the end of April. | #YetiCycles #Yeti575
