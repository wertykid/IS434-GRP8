For @sarahvirginiauhl a freelance fine art and commercial artist, her work—and her play— stem from flow. It’s why her mountain biking and her painting go hand in hand. And why, when she packs for a road trip, she always throws in both her Yeti Beti and art supplies. From Carbondale, Colo., where Sarah lives, Crested Butte is the perfect getaway: a mere scenic three-hour drive away, buff singletrack, ample campsites, and arguably the densest stands of aspens in the state. ⠀⠀⠀⠀
