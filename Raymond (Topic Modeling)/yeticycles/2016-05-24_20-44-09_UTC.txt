Link to film in profile! - Three Yeti ambassadors and childhood friends @joeyschusler, @sam_seward, and @mason_lacy set out for the far western corner of Mongolia to combine mountain biking and packrafting in a self-supported adventure into the unknown. Aboard the #SB5c and the #SB45c, this would be their first attempt at a mountain bike to packraft link-up in one of the most remote and sparsely populated places in the world. Told in detail in the upcoming July issue of @bikemag, the adventure that ensued pushed the boundaries of comfort, but also of what they knew of human generosity, camaraderie and the spirit of adventure that connects us all. #FlashesOfTheAltai #YetiTribe
