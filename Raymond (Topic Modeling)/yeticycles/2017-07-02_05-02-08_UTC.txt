Well in true trail busting style @richie_rude1 won the final stage at the Millau EWS. Although it was not enough to overcome the deficit from day 1, he set the tone for things to come in Aspen. He is ready to be  back in America and dry off from the Euro rain, then smash from turns in Colorado. We welcome you back Richie! #YetiCycles #RideDriven ⠀
