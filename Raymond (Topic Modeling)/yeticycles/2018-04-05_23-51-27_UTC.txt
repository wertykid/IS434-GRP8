"The allure of loam and steep descents up north are what keep my thoughts churning at night. After the repetition of summer events, I crave the deafening silence of the damp forest. Instead of winding down from a season of racing and riding, there is an intangible force that urges me to keep the wheels turning, no matter what the prevailing conditions suggest." @yetibetisarah gets in some BC loam runs with @reubenkrabbe this fall. Soon the winter's snow will be melting and many will flock to mountain biking mecca again. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #YetiBeti #MoreThanMyth
