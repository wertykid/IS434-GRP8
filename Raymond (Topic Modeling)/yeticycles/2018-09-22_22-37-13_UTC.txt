It all clicked today at the 7th stop of the @world_enduro series in Ainsa, Spain for @richie_rude1. When the day was done, covering nearly 5,000 feet of climbing, Richie had won all but one stage, put 12 seconds into the competition and is sitting in 1st. Yeti/FOX teammate @shawnneer had a solid day and is sitting in 23rd. On to day 2. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #StrengthForJared
