In the northwest corner of Italy beneath the shadow of Mont Blanc lies the Aosta Valley. A vast interconnected system of trails flows thousands of meters down from the peaks above into the valley below, creating a grand playground for mountain bikers. With the heat of the summer in full force and the snowpack receding, Yeti/Fox Factory team rider @shawnneer and ambassador @leetrumpore took a mid-season break. They escaped to the high elevations to explore and kick back. In only a few short months, the mountains will be covered in snow once again. Get ridinâ€™.
