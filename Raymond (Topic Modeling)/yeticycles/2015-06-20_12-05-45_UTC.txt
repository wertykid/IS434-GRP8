A crew of Yeti ambassadors are on a wild bikepacking trip in the former Soviet Union with the @bikemag crew for #TheTrailToKazbegi feature story. Here @joeyschusler winds his way through eerie abandoned castles perched high in the towering giants of the Caucasus Mountains. The high alpine regions are loaded with incredible single track around every corner if your willing to search for it. | Photo: @bricemag
