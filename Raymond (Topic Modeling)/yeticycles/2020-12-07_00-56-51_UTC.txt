Yeti Ambassador @leejonathan_ is methodical about his builds. His #SB130 is no different.

“The SB130 is my favorite mountain bike I’ve ever owned, and I’ve built it up in a way to allow it to be super versatile. It’s the perfect middle-ground bike. This bike weighs 28.6 lbs (12.9kgs) with these tires and drops all the way down to 27 lbs with the trail tire setup. Since this isn’t my XC race bike, weight is not a priority – ride quality and fun are the focus points on this trail bike.”
