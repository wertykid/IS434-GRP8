Another race season is on the horizon for @YetiCycles Fox Factory and National Teams. The team will set sights on the international and U.S. race circuits including the @WorldEnduro and @BigMountainEnduro and will be led by two-time EWS World Champion @Richie_Rude1 and returning Yeti National Team riders, @ShawnNeer and @JubalDavis. Neer locked down the BME overall title last year and is looking to do the same in 2018. The pro-team riders will be joined by U21 athlete, @DuncanNason. Nason captured a second-place finish at EWS Aspen in 2017, showing he has the muster to take on more international racing this season. Let's do this.
