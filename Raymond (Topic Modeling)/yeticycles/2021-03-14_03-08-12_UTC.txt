With over three days on track, the Yeti / @FOX Race Team is ready to tackle the steep, technical terrain that the Tennessee National is serving up. Tomorrow, @richie_rude1, @shawnneer, @quinnreece, and @warrenkniss will ride against the clock for the first time since last summer. 

Due to the weather, Rude made the call to pull out of the DH to focus on additional practice time for the enduro. Follow along tomorrow for race updates and results.
