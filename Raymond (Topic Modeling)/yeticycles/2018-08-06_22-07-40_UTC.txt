Calling it the "little bike that could" is fine by us, @geoffkabush. Kabush took the win and defended his title at the #DownievilleClassic in XC, DH and in the All-Mountain categories aboard the SB100. Head over to his feed to get the low down on his entire set up. Congrats Geoff. We have a feeling the fun has just begun. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
