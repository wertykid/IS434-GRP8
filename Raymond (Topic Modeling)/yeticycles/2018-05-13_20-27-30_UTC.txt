Yeti Fox Factory takes the win in the Men’s Pro field and the Men’s U21  @world_enduro round 3 in France. @richie_rude1 and @duncan_nason battled it out over a highly technical, long grueling course and earned the top step from the locals. Full race report tomorrow on the Yeti homepage. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth P: @davetrumporephoto
