A land largely unaffected by the progress of man, the Tetons Range and the surrounding areas are a pristine ecosystem inhabited by a vast diversity of wildlife spreading across multiple national parks. Uninhibited by foothills on the eastern side the range rises sharply and splits upper Wyoming and lower Idaho in two. On one side sits Jackson Hole, home to the legendary ski area and playground to outdoor junkies. On the other resides the Teton Valley: a landscape dotted with hay farms and the small rustic towns of eastern Idaho. Smack in the middle, off the pass that separates the two, lies some of the most progressive mountain bike trails in America. Local riders teaming with the Forest Service have created a network of trails designed and built specifically for riding. We explored both sides of the pass and rode varied terrain from purpose-built bike park features to backcountry singletrack, clinging to the edge of 10,000-foot peaks. The experience instilled a sense in us that the locals have got it figured out hereâ€¦ and the need for a satellite Yeti office in JH. #ProvenHere #Tetons video online now at YetiCycles.com
