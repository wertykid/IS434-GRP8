When you get down to it, @richie_rude1 is not like everyone else. Quiet by most accounts, he’s loudest when riding fast. In the final episode of the inaugural season of Talk Yeti To Me, @martyschaffer chats with Richie about what it takes to win, how it feels to lose, and his race-day mindset that keeps him calm, cool, and collected. Suffice to say, he loves biking and lives life at race pace. Link in bio.
