Together with @ridefoxbike, @pinkbike, and @santacruzbicycles, we have committed to collectively raise $500,000 to benefit @growcyclingfoundation.

Grow Cycling Foundation is focused on making cycling more accessible and provide opportunities that havenâ€™t been there before. The keystone of Grow Cycling Foundation will be a new pump track in a diverse area of Los Angeles. The pump track will serve as a community fixture that exposes people to the love for biking, as well as create cycling-centric pathways for career and life development.

To kick off support for this amazing program, Grow Cycling / Yeti / FOX SB150 Giveaway Sweepstakes will be giving out a fully decked out SB150. And we mean decked out: new Fox 38 fork and Float X2 shock, @rideshimano XTR drivetrain, and all the other bells and whistles you could want.

Yeti and FOX products are donated and all proceeds of the Yeti x FOX Giveaway Sweepstakes go to benefit the Grow Cycling Foundation.
