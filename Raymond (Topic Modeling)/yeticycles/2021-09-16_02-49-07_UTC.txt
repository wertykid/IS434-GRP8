With just 140 points separating @richie_rude1 and Jack heading into round seven, a win here was crucial to remain in contention for the overall series title.

Rude understood the assignment. He took the Pro Stage win and maintained his first place standing throughout the entire race – taking home the maximum points available and reclaiming the series lead. Teammate, @shawnneer had a few top ten finishes between the EWS and EWS-E, proving his track speed is there.

Yeti / OneUp Pro Team’s @kasper_woolley continued to push his pace. Feeling at home on the steep, rooty terrain, he took fourth-place finish on the Pro Stage and continued the momentum on Stage Two with a P5. “I felt like I was riding really well, but just had a few weird, little slip ups. Happy to still hold onto sixth with three crashes today.”
