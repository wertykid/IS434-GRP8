The 2014 lineup has arrived.  At the forefront is the new SB75. It's a five inch bike built on our Switch Technology platform, packaged in a 27.5" wheel size.  For 2014 we will also be offering a fully redesigned 27.5" wheeled 575, the SB66 and SB95 in a more affordable Comp kit, and the new upgraded alloy SB66 and SB95 with carbon rear end at no extra cost. | #YetiCycles #Yeti575 #SB66 #SB95 #SB75
