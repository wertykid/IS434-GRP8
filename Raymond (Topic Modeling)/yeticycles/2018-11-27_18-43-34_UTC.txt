At Yeti Cycles we believe in giving back to the trails, getting our hands dirty and shaping what we shred. Itâ€™s why we remain stewards and supporters of @imba_us, @combaorg and @goldengiddyup. This #GivingTuesday consider giving to your local trail organization or volunteering your time. If you're not sure how to connect with your local trail chapter, use the link in our bio. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #ShapeWhatYouShred
