Yeti Pro rider @kelleymtb was clearly in his groove on the loose, rocky and technical tracks this last weekend at the @world_enduro stop in Aspen. Clean runs void of mechanicals made him the top finisher on the Yeti Fox team. To celebrate, Cody is offering up one 'Merica jersey. Enter by posting a photo of your Yeti or riding your Yeti and tag Cody, @yeticycles and #RideDriven. Cody will choose his favorite next Thursday. May the best Yeti Freak win. â €
