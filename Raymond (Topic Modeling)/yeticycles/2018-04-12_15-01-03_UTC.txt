For the SB100 and SB100 Beti, the look and layout of our Switch Infinity mechanism was changed to best work with our shorter travel 100mm platform. Switch Infinity utilizes a translating pivot point that allows us to tune the suspension kinematics to our desired characteristics. The SB100 Switch Infinity link is rotated 90 degrees to allow for slimmer, more efficient packaging and is lighter than the previous design. We worked with @Fox to independently test the mechanism for durability, and wear and tear in the harshest conditions - but shielded it with an easy to remove cover to keep the crud out. The SB100 Switch Infinity uses its own hardware but performs exactly like the original. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
