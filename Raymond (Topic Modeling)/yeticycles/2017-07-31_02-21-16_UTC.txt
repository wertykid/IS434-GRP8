When the day started one might have predicated that Richie was poised for the overall win. So much can change in one day of racing. Fellow Yeti-Fox team riders @kellymtb , @shawnneer , and @jubaldavis  finished strong but @richie_rude1  had a flat and major off wrecking his chances for the day. Well that is racing, on to Whistler for Rd7. #YetiCycles #RideDriven ⠀
