Weâ€™re kicking off the 2021 @world_enduro season in true @richie_rude1 fashion.

Rude claims the first win of the season by just under half a second at the first of the two EWS events week in Canazei, Italy. Yeti / @FOX Factory teammate, @shawnneer felt fast and was happy with his track speed in the beginning of the day, but stage four proved difficult and ended the day with a couple crashes. Neer placed 25th overall. Still amongst some fast company

Yeti / OneUp Pro Team rider, @kasper_woolley is one week post getting the all clear for riding. His aimed for smooth, clean runs, and he did exactly that. Woolley placed 47th overall, but stands only to gain strength and speed throughout the season.

One race down, one to go of the Val di Fassa double header. With a brand new racing format for 2021, the second event, only three days away, is still up for grabs and is anyones game.

Full race report tomorrow.
