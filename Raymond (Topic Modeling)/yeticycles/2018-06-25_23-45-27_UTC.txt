Kids and bikes - wherever you are in the world, they go together. The chaotic streets of Kathmandu may not seem like a typical breeding ground for world-class mountain bikers, but then again nothing is typical about Rajesh Magar aka @rjripper. Since learning to ride on a beat-up, homemade clunker, to becoming the four-time National Champion at age 21, RJâ€™s story is one of boundless childhood dreaming and unstoppable determination, forged from junkyard scraps and tested on the rugged trails of the mighty Himalaya. Yeti Ambassador, @joeyschusler newest film is live. Link in bio. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth #RJRipperFilm
