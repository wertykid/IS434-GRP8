The cool air, the crisp falling leaves, fall is our favorite time of the year to ride. Yeti ambassadors @natehills1 and @dylan_stucki enjoy the empty trails in the Colorado high country last fall. Just a memory now, as snow is piled up high and deep in this spot now. What is your favorite season to ride?
