Yeti/FOX Factory Team riders, @richie_rude1 and @shawnneer kick off racing at @world_enduro Round 7 in Ainsa. The penultimate two-day race in the series holds plenty of challenges. Tomorrow will kick off with 41 km (25 miles) and equal climbing and descending at 1,700 meters (nearly 6,000 feet). #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven
