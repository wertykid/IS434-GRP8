“Long day in the saddle today, our first kind of big pedal weekend. But yeah, a little bit off the pace today – kind of annoying. I felt really good, just wasn’t on the pointy end I guess. I got fired up for the last stage and got second on that with some good points going into the final race. I gotta go for the win in Scotland. Treat it like any other race, just be confident and put down a good one.” - Richie Rude. He finished the weekend in 5th overall.

Trailing by just 70 points, you can bet that Rude will leave it all on the dirt as he chases down the title with everything he’s got.
