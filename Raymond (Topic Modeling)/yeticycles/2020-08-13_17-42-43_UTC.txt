We are committed to change.

Former Yeti Cycles rider @eliotjackson is the founder of @growcyclingfoundation. A foundation that serves to educate and provide access and opportunity that advance diversity and inclusion in cycling. All of us at Yeti Cycles, along with the other founding members @fox, @santacruzbicycles, @redbull, @pinkbike, Be Good Foundation, are all in it to provide paths for cycling to become a life-long passion. Collectively, we are all committed to support Grow Cycling Foundation and their four pillars of “education, opportunity, community and access that create solutions and provide entry points at various steps of a cyclist’s journey.”

We’ll keep you updated on how Yeti is helping work towards this mission. In the meantime, follow Elliot and @growcyclingfoundation as we work together to make cycling more inclusive and welcoming to all.
