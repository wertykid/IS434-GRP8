Here at Yeti we affectionately call our engineering team, the Enginerds. In this episode of TYTM @martyschaffer sits down with the biggest nerd of them all to bring you the inside story of how the beautiful mind of Stretch (aka Peter Zawistowski, Yeti’s Director of Engineering) and his team of bike nerds were able to create Yeti’s first e-MTB. Also sitting in on this party is Rocket (Ryan Thornberry), our Bike Product Manager, who is responsible for making sure that the designs that comes out of Stretch’s head actually gets delivered to you, in the form of a real bike.
