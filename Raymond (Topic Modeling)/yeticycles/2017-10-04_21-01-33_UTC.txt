A paved road leads up Cypress mountain. A meniscus crushing, dehydration inducing, serpentine path of suffering that's well traveled by lycra wearing chumps, and tourist vehicles trying to gain perspective on the metropolis of Vancouver. It could be pedaled, but we could also ride the coattails of some unsuspecting tourist, so we wait instead. A sloth paced RV pulls into view, an awkwardly long amount of time passes as we look into the RV's windshield as it inches towards us up the hill. It stops, and moments later three bikes are getting crammed into the RV's walkway. Every pickup so far have been from Quebecois drivers. For some reason, they’ve been our saviors. I'm trying to make small talk with the family's two French speaking children, while Tobin banters away with the driving parents.⠀
