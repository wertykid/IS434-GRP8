Last week, @geoffkabush added the SB130 to his quiver and headed to the Northwest forests for some loam and mayhem @transcascadia. No punches were thrown this year, but a dang good time was had by all. Geoff, the ever prolific racer, finished four days of racing in 5th and then promptly got on a plane to Arkansas to race the final stop in the @epicrides Off-Road Series. As he says, keep riding until the fun stops.
