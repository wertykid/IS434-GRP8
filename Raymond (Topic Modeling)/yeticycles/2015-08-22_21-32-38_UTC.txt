Sandwiched between high alpine glaciers and camels is not your typical scene from the single track, but what would you expect from our adventurous trio of Yeti ambassadors @sam_seward, @mason_lacy, & @joeyschusler. The crew just finished up a 12 day self supported bikepack to packraft adventure in the Altai Mountains of Western Mongolia. Keep an eye out for the full feature and short film from the trip dropping early 2016.
