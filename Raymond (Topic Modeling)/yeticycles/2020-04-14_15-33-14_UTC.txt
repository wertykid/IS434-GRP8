Health care workers have always taken care of us. Patching riders up countless times since 1985. So in an effort to give back and help the heroes on the front lines, we’ve temporarily refocused our production efforts to making PPE shields that help to extend the safe use of an N95 mask. Production began on Saturday and we’re ramping up to produce 1,000 shields a day. Thank you @smithoptics @blackdiamond  @uwmadison and @vcgraphix_ for the help.

We need your help getting in touch with those in need in Colorado. If you are a healthcare worker or first responder, please email us at donations@yeticycles.com. Or if you know someone in need, please share this post with them. Link in bio for more info.
