We knew @shawnneer was a damn good bike rider, but are still in awe of his result this past weekend at the New Mexico Pro GRT race. 1st place aboard his souped-up #SB6c in a field full of fast pros and big downhill bikes. Congrats, Shawn. | #RaceBred #SwitchInfinity #YetiCycles | Photo by @davetrumporephoto from a spring training ride.
