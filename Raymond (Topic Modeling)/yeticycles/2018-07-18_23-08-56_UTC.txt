Lads and lassies – wait no more. The Highlands of Scotland are calling. We have a few spots left on our co-ed and Beti Tribe International – Scotland. The co-ed trip takes off from Inverness on Aug 25 and wraps up on Sept 1. Beti Tribe Scotland runs Sept 1 through Sept 8. Both include miles of gnarly, rocky, rooty singletrack as we head from east to west starting in the Cairngorms and ending in the Cuillin and Torridon mountains rising out of the Atlantic Ocean. The entire journey will be led by @mountainbikeworldwide local guides with plenty of Scottish flavor like world-class whiskey.
