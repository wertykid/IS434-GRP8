Some races feel less like a competition between riders and more like a competition between rider and trail. Such was the case for the Yeti Fox Factory Team over the weekend @world_enduro round 7 in Whistler. This year the race kicked off with the storied and highly technical Top of the World trail. Just over 7 km later, three of the seven Yeti riders had succumb to mechanicals or gnarly stack ups leaving either their bodies or bikes useless. Athletes @richie_rude1, @shawnneer in the pro-men category and @duncan_nason and @paulserra2204 in U21, would muster the strength and focus to charge on. Richie struggled to find his rhythm all day but by stages 4 and 5 it finally clicked. He took 3rd and 1st respectively. It wasn't, enough, however, to win the day and Richie ended up 12th.
