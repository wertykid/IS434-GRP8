"We'd dragged our good buddy, film-maker @joeyschusler, to the remote corner of southwest China to bikepack a high altitude circuit around three extraordinary mountains considered sacred by the Tibetan people. 
Known as the 'Yading Kora,' this multi-day pilgrimage beneath a triangle of snow-clad, 19,000-plus-foot peaks is a rite of passage for Tibetans. For these hardy plateau dwellers, a 'kor' - or completed circamambulation of mountains historically ordained as holy by various Dalai Lamas - will purify a lifetime of negative karma." Pick up the May issue of @bikemag to read @bricemag The Kora - A Two-wheeled Pilgrimage of Purification. Check out screenings of #TheKoraFilm at @mountainfilm at the end of May.  #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
