Another win in the bag for @richie_rude1 after two big days between the tape at the Big Sky @bigmountainenduro.

Rude was able to claim the lead straight out of the gate and it remained that way throughout the entire eight-stage race.

Yeti / @FOX teammate, @shawnneer ended the day 5th despite a lingering hip injury from La Thuile. @lauren_bingham_ and @quinnreece continue to deliver top ten results with a P6 and P10 respectively.
