Aluminum in the front, carbon in the rear. The SB95 comes in at just a half pound heavier than the full carbon SB95C version, at a price that is much more affordable. The carbon rear end, now standard, increases the stiffness while giving the bike a much more lively ride. Top that with great availability and the new SB95 is a no brainer for your new summer ride. Check one out today at your local Yeti dealer. | Yeti Ambassador @lydlovesmud ripping on the Colorado Trail earlier this week. | #YetiCycles #SB95
