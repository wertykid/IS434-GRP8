"I love going out several times a year when the weather is at its gnarliest. To experience a landscape when temperature or precip hit their hyperbole gives you an appreciation for how and why a location has its own character and identity. Until you’ve ridden through fog thick enough to chew on the coast, the Old Man’s Beard on the trees don’t mean nearly as much." - Yeti Ambassador, @reubenkrabbe on riding in the winter months. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
