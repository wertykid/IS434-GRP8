The Yeti / @FOX Factory, National, Devo Team as well as the Yeti / OneUp Pro Team crew has rolled into Winter Park with a fully stacked roster, with almost every race athlete getting between the tape for the third @bigmountainenduro of the season.

Practice day was in true Trestle fashion - hot and dry, a far cry from the showy welcome we had in 2020. There is no room for mistakes with only four stages in tomorrowâ€™s one day race.

Tune in tomorrow as @richie_rude1 , and @kasper_woolley once again battle for the top of the box at The Winter Park BME
