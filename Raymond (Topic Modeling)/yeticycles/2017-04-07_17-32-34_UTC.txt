@kelleymtb running some practice laps on the course in Tasmania. Conditions are looking dry for now, which bodes well for racing. Cody "Manual Monday" Kelley has crazy and unique skillz on the bike, we'll see how much of that can carry over to top-speed on the track this weekend. #YetiCycles #RideDriven ⠀
