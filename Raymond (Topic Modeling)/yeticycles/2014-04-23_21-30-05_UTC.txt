The beauty seen riding in the Cordillera Huayhuash is unrivaled. The extreme elevation of the trail (almost all above 14,000ft) and remote nature of the zone make it a difficult place to get to, but it's almost always worth it. Yeti ambassadors @joeyschusler, @samwseward, and @thomaswoodson went fully self supported on this loop for 8 days. Be sure to check out the @bikemag short film and multimedia feature launching Monday, April 28th. | #YetiCycles #Yeti575 #HuayhuashFilm
