Richie Rude won’t tell you many details about his run that locked down the Junior World Championship DH title for him in 2013. Or how he comes back from flats or mechanicals on the most challenging enduro tracks in the world to win stages - seemingly out of nowhere. And he isn’t one to boast about back-to-back EWS World Championships. When you ask him how he rides at such daunting speeds with undebatable skill, it’s usually in five words or less and accompanied by an unassuming shoulder shrug. @richie_rude1 is the Silent Shredder. ⠀
