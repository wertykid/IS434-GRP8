Well the rains came as predicted and turned the dry, dusty, rough course into a mud strewn slip fest. @richie_rude1 powered through to a 4th place finish. A result that keeps him in good standing for the overall. With the next EWS race a month away in the predictably dry May weather of Madeira, it should favor Richie's track crushing skills. #YetiCycles #RideDriven ⠀
