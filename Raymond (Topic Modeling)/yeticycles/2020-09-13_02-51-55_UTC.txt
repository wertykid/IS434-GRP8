Conditions were prime and the tracks were firing. Day two of practice at the @bigmountainenduro was more like one would expect.  Yesterday’s conditions made it almost a write-off.

The Yeti / @fox Factory team is no stranger to laying down fast times at Trestle, @richie_rude1 has won multiple BME’s and a national championship title at this venue. After a less than stellar result at Big Sky, Richie is looking forward to get back to the familiar venue and his winning ways.

“I have been riding with Kasper quite a bit. Taking laps and chasing each other has been really fun, but I always wanna win. I’m here to ride smooth, not make any mistakes and push myself as hard as I can” - Richie Rude
