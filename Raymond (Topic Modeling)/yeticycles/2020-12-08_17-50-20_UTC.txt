Dan Milner reimagines what can be done out his back door.

“When your world gets turned upside down, you have to reach for self-righting mechanisms; and when my plans as a global-travel photographer got put by the pandemic-shaped wayside, I knew I still needed a taste of adventure in my life — I’d just have to find it locally instead. Think global, act local, right? I rode from my backdoor, pedaling, then pushing, and finally shouldering my #SB140 to the top of the nearest peak, 4600 ft above home, where I knew, even between lockdowns, I’d find no-one else. Alone for a night, surrounded by huge vistas and a vast starry sky, I had the chance to find some context in the strange and challenging world that had suddenly fallen on us, reconnecting with the dirt, the rocks, and the damp grass around my bivouac and refocussing on life skills at their simplest level; brewing tea and listening out for wolves.

It was just one night. But it was one night when I had certainty in 10 months of chaos, and I’m thankful for that. All it took was some lateral thinking, some sweat, and a bike.” - @danmilnerphoto
