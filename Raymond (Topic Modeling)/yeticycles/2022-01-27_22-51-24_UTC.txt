Getting over 20 Yeti freaks together in Madeira for the International Gathering last fall was made just that much more special after the 2020 hiatus.

“The crew was simply stoked to be riding with people who were having as much fun as they were.” A week of bikes, crashes, beer, and commodore later, we left thankful that we were able to gather and share the epic trails the little province of Portugal had to offer.
