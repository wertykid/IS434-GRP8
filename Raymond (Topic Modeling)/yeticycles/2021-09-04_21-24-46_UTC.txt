The super steep Pro Stage trend lives on in Loudenvielle. @richie_rude1, @shawnneer, and @kasper_woolley are one stage down with five more to go tomorrow for the sixth @world_enduro. Unlike the torrential rain that ushered in EWS.5, tomorrow is looking to be sunny and dry. Going in to stage two, Richie is less than two seconds back from first. Tune in as the day unfolds.
