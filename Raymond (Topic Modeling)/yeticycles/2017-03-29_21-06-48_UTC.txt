Heading out into the unknown, we bush-wacked our way in. With dissension among the ranks and night closing in, our perseverance was rewarded. We found fresh dirt preserved under the cover of past seasons’ fallen flora. Nature preserving nature. As our knobbed tires uncovered these un-tracked trails, hoots and hollers echoed among the trees. Link in bio to video. #YetiCycles #ProvenHere ⠀
