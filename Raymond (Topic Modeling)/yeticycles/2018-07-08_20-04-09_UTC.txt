@richie_rude1 and @duncan_nason went one, two yesterday topping the Pro Men's podium at the third stop of the @bigmountainenduro series @keystone_resort. As is par for the course at Keystone, it was dry, dusty and loose. Familiar territory for Richie, his race plan for the weekend was to stay on @world_enduro pace - as such he put about a minute on his teammate by day's end. Stage 4 proved to be the most technical, but Richie made quick and tidy work of it, putting 20 seconds into his competition on that stage alone. Yeti Devo rider @lmbmtb also put in a solid effort for the day coming in 4th on the Pro Women's podium.
