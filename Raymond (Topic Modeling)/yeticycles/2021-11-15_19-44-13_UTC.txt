“My #SB130 is built up from scratch for the conditions on my favorite trails in Squamish. I’m borderline on Yeti sizing but like the Large SB130 for the more technical and tight trails. The Lunch Ride option with extra travel and the X2 rear shock to tilt it more towards the gravity side. DoubleDown @maxxisbike tires F/R to keep up with it’s capability and full @rideshimano for reliability up North. A few orange touches with the @oneupcomponents chainguide and custom Lizard Skins grips make the bike special to me.” - @geoffkabush
