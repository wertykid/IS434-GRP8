Occasionally we capture Yeti Ambassador, photographer and videographer @joeyschusler on the other side of the lens. Fellow ambassador @thomaswoodson caught this moment on the annual megaride when Joey invites buddies and Yeti staff to travel, mostly by bike, from Boulder to Winter Park and back. The trip covers 60+ plus miles each way and enough climbing to crest the Continental Divide. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
