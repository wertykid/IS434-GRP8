As @richie_rude1 made it to the Whistler Village last evening after a long day of racing, it was apparent that the day’s work which had him set up for a head-to-head battle on the final stage, wasn’t to be. Flats happen and there aren’t many people who can make it down in one piece riding 18 minutes on rubber, foam and rims. Great showing by teammates @shawnneer who took home 16th and @duncan_nason, finishing 22nd in Men’s U21. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
