Rude claims 2nd overall for the 2021 @world_enduro season despite being unable to compete in the final round. “There was some confusion on the bottom of the Pro Stage regarding gates and tape and I unfortunately got the shit end of the stick when I decided to go around one of them and I shouldn’t have. The ol’ commissaires decided to throw me a DQ and cut my weekend short and any chances of going for the overall win. Yeah, so that was a bit of a bummer for sure. I couldn’t be happier having this season and how it went.” - @richie_rude1

@kasper_woolley clinched yet another top-ten finish, taking 7th on the day and 12th overall.  Don’t let Kappy’s casual and slightly sarcastic race day demeanor fool you. Woolley is a weapon on the bike and a name to watch in 2022.

@shawnneer had a big week on the pedals between the EWS and EWS-E. “I am really jiving with the 160E. It would be nice we had a day off in between the races, but its time on the bike and it’s what we love to do.” Neer placed 12th in the EWS-E with top-ten finishes in 7 of 14 stages, and 43rd in the EWS.

And with that, the 2021 race season is over. We’d like to extend a massive thank you to our sponsors and everyone who helps make our race program what it is.
