Rain has become a staple on the EWS circuit this year and when racers awoke on Saturday morning to see the skies had opened up and mud and puddles riddled the pits, it seemed Mother Nature has dealt another interesting hand. Colorado dirt however, had other plans and while the early starters wrestled with slick conditions, the tracks had dried before the pros toed the line. With weeks of elevation prep under his belt and a hunger for a win, @richie_rude1 won the day despite crashes on stage 2 and 3. Tracks are dry for Sunday and stages 4-6 hold a few more technical challenges than what riders saw in the first three stages. With a 10-second lead, Richie is focused on taking it all the way home.
