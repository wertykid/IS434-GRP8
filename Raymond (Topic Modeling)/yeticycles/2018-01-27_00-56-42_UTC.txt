Two days well spent on the Old Ghost Road. The intrepid crew of Yeti Freaks on our third-annual International Yeti Tribe Gathering departed the drier plains of the days prior to venture into the New Zealand rainforests via the fabled road. Established by gold miners, the long and steadily climbing trail passes through old mining sites and derelict ghost towns. The reward at the peak is a panoramic view of the rainforest below and a nightâ€™s stay at the Ghost Lake hut. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth Photos: @rossbellphoto
