Yeti Ambassador and athlete, @natehills1 is a pretty mild- mannered individual. Occasionally, he likes to give us all a bit of a heart attack- like he did here on mega-ride over the Continental Divide earlier this year. @thomaswoodson snapped this shot and all lived to the tell the tale. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
