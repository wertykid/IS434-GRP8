Last year, when we designed the SB5 with all-new geometry and design – we all thought it looked a lot like the old chum we knew and loved. When we got aboard this capable trail bike in Whitefish, Montana we were suddenly clearing technical climbs with far less effort and our descents were more playful and speedy than before. It’s tough to make a great thing better, but we feel confident we got it right. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth⠀
