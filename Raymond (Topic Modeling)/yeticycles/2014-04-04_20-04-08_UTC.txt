The Pandora Duffle â€” A durable 75L duffle bag built with waterproof fabrics and burly zippers. The bag features a removable tool pouch, padded sunglasses pocket, and an extra wet/dry bag for your dirty, sweaty clothes. While it can double-time for a casual vacation, the Pandora Duffle was designed with the Mountain bike at the center of it's attention. | #YetiCycles
