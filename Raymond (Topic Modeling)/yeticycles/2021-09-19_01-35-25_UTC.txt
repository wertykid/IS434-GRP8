The Yeti team has raced Finale Ligure many times over, but the brand new Pro Stage proved to be a challenge for nearly the entire field. The raw, brand new track was steep with super-tight back-to-back switchbacks and jank nearly everywhere. With nothing yet burned in, line choice was paramount

Less than a second separate Rude and Moir going into Stages 2-5. Tune in as tomorrow unfolds. 

Pro Stage:
3rd: @richie_rude1 
15th: @kasper_woolley 
106th: @shawnneer
