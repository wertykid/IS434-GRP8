With the Yeti / @FOX Factory Team in transit to Europe, it’s the Nat / Devo Team’s turn to shine. @quinnreece , @warrenkniss , and @lauren_bingham_ have put in two solid days of practice and are ready to take on the steep, loose tracks that Purgatory is serving up. Equal parts techy descent and soul-crushing transfers mean that endurance will play a large role in determining success throughout the weekend.

Stages one - four are on deck for tomorrow, with stages five and six on Sunday. This is looking to be one of the rowdiest @bigmountainenduro stops this year, be sure to tune in tomorrow to see how it all unfolds.
