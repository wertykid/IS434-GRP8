The long days of the summer months in this northern region led to multiple ride sessions in the day. In the morning, we hit up the local townie flow trails of Spencer Mountain. In the later afternoon when the daylight stretched well into the evening, we headed deeper to more remote locations. #YetiCycles #ProvenHere ⠀
