"Mountain biking is a part of my soul. Life is all about mountain biking for me. No other job has given me what mountain biking has." He is @rjripper. Rising up from abject poverty to become Nepal's fastest mountain biker, Rajesh Magar has made a life and career of mountain biking. See @joeyschusler's most recent creation #RJRipperFilm at Yeti Cycles headquarters in Golden, Colo. this Wednesday, June 20th. Follow the link in our bio to purchase tickets and for more info. All proceeds go to benefit RJ's race fund and visa bid. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
