True to its reputation, the @world_enduro is dishing up wet conditions for its fourth installment of the season. With some of the longest stages in EWS history spanning the border between Austria and Slovenia, it will be a very physical raceâ€” steep trails, tight switchbacks, and a ridiculous amount of roots. If the weather brightens, conditions will be all-time. If the rain continues, the deathly slick roots and limestone will become treacherous. Follow along for updates on the Yeti/FOX Factory Team throughout the weekend. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
