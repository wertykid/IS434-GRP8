With several miles and many races logged on his SB100, Yeti Ambassador @leejonathan_ writes his long term review. Check it out. “My favorite bike of all time, the @yeticycles #SB100. I’ve had two years refining this platform, and I’ve learned a lot along the way.

1. The rear end on this bike is so good that it’s hard to find a fork to match. It’s been tricky for me to get the SC34 to match like I wanted, but the @mrpbike Ribbon SL is a darn near perfect match. Initially supple but somehow supportive, a stable platform, and very progressive.

2. I up’d my spring rate in the rear with the fork change and am running 171psi as a result. It removes a hair of the initial suppleness, but makes the bike incredibly composed when you are on the gas.

3. This bike likes responds increasingly favorably as rider input progresses, even in the gnarliest terrain. In other words, take control of this thing, slap berms, send drops and go for the risky line with confidence – it’ll reward you.

This bike is the only one that gives me #newbikeday feels every time I ride it, and I can’t wait to build up my 2020 and test out a couple changes. Cheers to race bikes, cheers to short travel and big wheels, and cheers to the bike your XC bike warned you about.” - Jonathan Lee
