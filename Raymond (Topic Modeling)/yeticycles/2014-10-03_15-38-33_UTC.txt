It's hard to beat Colorado riding in the fall. Cold crisp air, empty trails, tacky dirt, a dusting of snow on the high peaks, and golden aspen trees galore. A crew of Yeti riders and ambassadors met up this past week for one last riding trip to the high country for the year. Stay tuned for more images and video from the trip in the following months. | #YetiTribe #YetiFallGathering #ColoradoFall | Photo: @joeyschusler
