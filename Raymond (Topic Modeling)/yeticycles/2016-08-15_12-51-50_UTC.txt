@richie_rude1 takes the win at EWS #6 in Whistler, BC. After flatting in stage 2 Richie had to dig himself out of a hole. Battling back in stages 3 and 4, it came down to the last stage. Riding from the â€œTop of The World" he put over 15 seconds into the field marking an epic comeback. With the win in stage 5 he was 7 seconds faster in the overall. #YetiCycles #RideDriven
