At the @world_enduro Round 3 in Ireland, Yeti Pro Rider @kelleymtb had his best finish yet coming in 30th. Kelley and teammate @richie_rude1 learn from each other and work diligently to become better riders and athletes, progressing the sport. Over the next week, post a photo of your Yeti or riding your Yeti showing your own progression and tag it #YetiCycles and #RideDriven. Next Thursday, we'll pick one winner and send you a replica of Cody Kelley's jersey from EWS Round 3.
