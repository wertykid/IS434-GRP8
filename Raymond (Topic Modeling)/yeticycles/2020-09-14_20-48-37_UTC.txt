Big Mountain Enduro Winter Park laid on the heat. The day was bookended with stages that physically challenged every single athlete on track with soul crushing climbs. There would be no phoning this one in. @kasper_woolley and @richie_rude1 battled it out stage after stage and Woolley, once again, would prove he is relentlessly fast, claiming the overall win from Richie Rude by over five seconds.
