It isnâ€™t easy, but @richie_rude1 sure makes it look that way. Rude is three-for-three for top of the box @bigmountainenduro finishes in 2021.

The Aussie and Canadian duo that is the Yeti / OneUp team raced for the first time together since its creation in 2020. @jaredgravesmtb and @kasper_woolley finished 3rd and 4th, respectively.

Devo Team rider @quinnreece put it all together this weekend and earned himself a 5th place spot and his first podium of the 2021 season.

Full race report Monday.
