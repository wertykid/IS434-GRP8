As a mountain biker, there are moments that you don’t soon forget. It was the last day of our trip to Iceland riding and testing the SB4.5c and we were met with a cold rainy morning. Motivation was beginning to fizzle. We waited out the storm and as it subsided we were left with tacky trails, brisk air, and nothing but muddy grins on our faces as we made our way down the winding trail parallel to countless waterfalls, ending at the famed Skógafoss. A perfect ride to end yet another grand adventure on two wheels. #YetiCycles #ProvenHere #SB45c
