We learned today that former Yeti racer @jaredgravesmtb has a brain tumor. He’s a legend by any definition. He has multiple world champion titles, represented Australia in the Olympics, and one of the most talented bike riders. Ever. And, he’s one of the most down-to-earth, friendly, professional racers you’ll ever meet. We’re proud to call him part of the Yeti family and want to send out good vibes and a speedy recovery as he heads into surgery.
