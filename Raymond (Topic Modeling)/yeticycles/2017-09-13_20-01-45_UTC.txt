The best way to describe Yeti’s design philosophy is with a quick view into our product meetings. Recently, we debated gear ratios and what front chainring size we should model our kinematics around. Scenarios were laid out from all angles. Climbing, descending, Apex, Nor Cal, Whistler and racing. It was spirited and took the better part of the afternoon.⠀ ⠀
Some would say we dive too deep into the minutia, but this is the ethos of Yeti. It isn’t a battle of egos. It’s about making sure we make the best riding mountain bikes. We have the luxury of making product decisions in a vacuum – no bean counters looking over our shoulders, no focus groups and nobody to answer to except the Tribe.⠀ ⠀
Once the decision is made, there is no second guessing. We easily move on with the comfort knowing that the collective scrutiny produced the right direction.⠀ ⠀
The 2018 bike line is not the result of a one or two-year development project. It is born from years of making tough product decisions. Chris and I know that perfection will forever be a moving target, yet we will always strive for it. We’re excited to present the new product line. Hope you enjoy it.⠀ ⠀
