It’s happening. We’re heading to the Northern Hemisphere for our next International Yeti Tribe Gathering. In September of 2018 @mountainbikeworldwide is taking us to their home base in Scotland. We’ll ride and explore from the rolling Cairngorms in the east to the Cuillin and Tortidon mountains rising out of the Atlantic Ocean in the west for 7 days and 8 nights. Co-ed and Beti trips will be offered. Each trip is capped at 20 riders and will sell out. Link for co-ed trip in our bio. #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
