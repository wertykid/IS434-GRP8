Day one of the @world-enduro series round 3 in France is a wrap. @richie_rude1 came out of the gates swinging, winning three of four stages taking the overall lead for the day. Teammates @shawnneer and @jubaldavis are sitting in 30th and 37th. U21 phenom @duncan_nason is in second after and just 11 seconds off the lead. Tomorrow delivers another four stages with hopes for delivery to the top step for the boys in turq. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
