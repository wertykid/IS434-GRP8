The pressure is on. Richie Rude is two for three as the @world_enduro heats up.

@richie_rude1 claimed the top spot at EWS.3 La Thuile yesterday despite less than ideal conditions for stage three and four when the rain set in, winning stages one, two, and four (QS).

@kasper_woolley made the leap into the top ten, finishing 7th overall. A week of training and suspension testing in Finale, Italy, was exactly what Woolley needed to get back up to speed.

Yeti / @FOX Factory teammate, @shawnneer had an off race, crediting his lack of wet training time. Knowing what he needs to improve, he is looking forward to his chance for redemption in La Thuile.

EWS.4 kicks off Saturday and concludes on Sunday. Tune in to see how the Yeti / FOX and Yeti / OneUp Pro Team fare.
