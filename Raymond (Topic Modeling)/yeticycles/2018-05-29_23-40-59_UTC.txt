In the fall months racing isn't at the forefront of Yeti/Fox Factory team rider @shawnneerâ€™s mind. He's still pushing limits however - limits of time, physics and mental fortitude - all aspects that make for a formidable opponent on the race track. His last "race" of the season, as the leaves turn to gold and the snow threatens to cover the trail, feels like a victory. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
