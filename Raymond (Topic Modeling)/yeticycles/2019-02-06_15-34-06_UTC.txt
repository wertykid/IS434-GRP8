@mountainbikeworldwide owners and hosts of our International Tribe Gatherings, Euan Wilson and Cat Shearer are masters of the #ArtofAdventure. Euan notes that for the 10 years they have carefully researched and crafted mountain bike trips around the world.
"The route, the trails, the accommodation, the food, the flow of the day, the flow of the entire week; all thought through to make sure each day is unforgettable. Like the soundtrack of a movie, our adventures have an indefinable quality that subconsciously heightens the senses."
We have a handful of spots left on our co-ed and Beti Tribe International Gatherings this summer in Switzerland. Follow the link in our bio to register.
