What a race. The rain came in overnight, making the gravity heavy course harder to read with variable trail conditions and patchy light. 

@richie_rude1 left it all between the tape in the second half of the La Thuile doubleheader. He maintained the lead he earned in yesterdayâ€™s Pro Stage until Stage Four. Despite a P11 on S4, Rude ended the day strong and on the podium once again with a second-place finish.

@kasper_woolley finished the day 13th, and @shawnneer placed 94th after a fall on Stage Three that changed the course of his day.

Full race report Monday.
