We’re (finally) racing now. And we’re damn stoked about it.

With “training” season extended nearly four months, this race was anyone’s game. The Yeti / @FOX Factory Team raced eight stages over two days totaling almost thirty minutes on track. Hungry for first, @shawnneer claimed 7 seconds on stage eight, but the top spot came down a difference of just .8 seconds with @mitchropo taking the win in the first @bigmountainenduro of the season.
