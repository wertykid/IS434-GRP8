Employee bike check — @christian.peper’s Space Oddity.

Frame: @yeticycles SB140 / Medium, painted by @tec_gnar
Shock: short-stroked @ridefoxbike DPS shock for 125mm
Fork: Fox 36 dropped from 160mm to 140mm+full tokens
Wheels: @envecomposites M730 rims (27.5”) built around @chriskingbuzz’s new violet ISO hubs
Tires: @maxxistires Ikon tires (45psi, tubeless).
Stem: @envecomposites M7 carbon stem
Handlebar: ENVE M7 carbon bar 40mm rise
Grips: @deitycomponents Lockjaw grips
Pedals: Deity Bladerunner pedals
Chain Ring: @absoluteblack.cc 30t oval ring / Chris King Violet edition (not in production)
Extras: @stikrd Purple chrome full-bike decal kit
The oddities: Only a rear brake (SRAM G2) because it won't be doing much downhill. Rigid carbon seatpost trimmed to 6" long, for light weight and minimalism. 7-speed SRAM drivetrain, since I don't plan to climb much and am hoping a short-cage derailleur will be lighter/stronger. The derailleur is run by a mini, modified GripShift, because I don’t want the shifter triggers getting stuck in my belt or pockets on tuck no-handers. To shift I use just the flange and otherwise have a full lock-on grip for normal riding.
