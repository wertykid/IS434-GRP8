Hot damn that new SB150 is fast and now it has another race win to prove it. @richie_rude1 piloted the new long-travel 29er enduro rig to the top podium spot @burkemountainofficial North American Continental Enduro Series stop. The race included the new Rude Awakening trail, named for Yeti's fastest racer. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth #SB150
