Big wheels take big wins. @richie_rude1 , @duncan_nason and @oldman_west all piloted the SB5.5 to podium finishes last weekend in France for @world_enduro Round 3. Monster 29-inch wheels, 5.5 inches of travel on @yeticycles Switch Infinity suspension platform are an indisputable winning combo. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
