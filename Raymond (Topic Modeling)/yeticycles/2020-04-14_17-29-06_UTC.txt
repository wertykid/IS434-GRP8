“We typically design products from the ground up, but in this case we wanted an efficient way to make the most effective thing. Time is critical, so we’re doing it with materials we’ve pulled together from industry friends @smithoptics @blackdiamond  and @vcgraphix_ and what’s available through our supply chain. We’re building in our factory in Golden, CO. It’s not surprising, but everyone we contacted wanted to help and their help was critical in this coming together so quickly.” - Steve Hoogendoorn

Thank you to everyone on the front lines.
