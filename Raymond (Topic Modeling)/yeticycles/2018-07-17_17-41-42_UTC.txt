The third year of the @transbcenduro is a wrap. Yeti ambassadors @tomsampson3, @natehills1 and @oldman_west finished six days of some of the toughest enduro-style stage racing in the world all sitting on the podium. Sampson and Hills finished 3rd and 5th in Open Men and West took the win in the Masters Men’s category as they raced their way across the Southwest Kootenays of British Columbia. Trans BC mastermind as well as Yeti ambassador @megan.j.rose is already looking towards 2019 planning. Registration for next year’s race will open in October of this year. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
