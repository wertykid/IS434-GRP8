Congratulations to Yeti Cycles Ambassador, guide, and three-time Nepali National MTB Champion @rjripper for being nominated as a @natgeo "Adventurer of the Year." Known as RJ Ripper to his friends and Yeti family, he first raced his country's national championship on a "franken-bike" he fabricated from old bike and motorcycle parts. He later caught the eye of a local bike racer, guide company owner, and distributor, @mandilpradhan. Mandil took RJ under his wing and along with help from the global mountain bike community and RJ's family, RJ became one of the fastest mountain bikers in Asia. Check out RJ's story by following the link in our bio. This June fellow Yeti Ambassador and filmmaker, @joeyschusler, will release a 20-minute film telling RJ's incredible story. This is just the beginning.
