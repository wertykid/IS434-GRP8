Yeti owners @yeticonroy and @yetihoog with 18 other Yeti Freaks, just set off on their two-week adventure across the south island of New Zealand for the third annual Yeti International Tribe Gathering. For the first two days @mountainbikeworldwide took the crew to pedal trails of Port Hill around Christchurch and near Hanmer. Both days covered about 50 km, included ocean views and ended in a dip in the South Pacific and local hot springs. P: @rossbellphoto #YetiCycles #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
