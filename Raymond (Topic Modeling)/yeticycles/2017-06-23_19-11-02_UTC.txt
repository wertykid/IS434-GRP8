We finally caught a break in the weather and made an early morning attempt at an unnamed, 13,000-foot pass that would eventually leads us to Silverton. There is something about predawn alpine starts that seems to intensify the sense of adventure. Maybe it's the cool air, or the rough transition from deep sleep to mouth breathing exertion. #YetiTribe #MoreThanMyth ⠀
