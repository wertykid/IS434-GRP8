Day 2 of the @world_enduro greeted riders with perfect trail conditions - fresh loam, hero dirt, and technical, raw tracks. Bouncing between Slovenia and Austria for the final three stages of the weekend, it was a battle to the very end. @richie_rude1 held out for 21st place and @shawnneer was close behind in 28th. #YetiCycles #RaceBred #RideDriven #MoreThanMyth
