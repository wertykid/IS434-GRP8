Our man on the mountain @garyperkin got this shot of @scottchapinator aboard his #Bronson on the way to a 3rd in Masters. The kid @seanieb63 also took 3rd in U19 so we are sporting more bronze than a Rodin. Stay tuned for more updates from the #AndesPacifico this week!

World Cup DH crew @StevePeat, @GregMinnaar, @loicbruni29 & @samdale90 all finished up the WC season then made the trip over to the north coast of Italy to take a shot at the @World_Enduro season finale. 
I‚Äôm guessing that Finale's beaches and food may have played a part in their decision‚Ä¶.

Proud to be Singaporean

Many of you guys might not know this, but ReEvolution actually started as a small operation out of Winson's apartment (back when he still had long hair!). Through sheer hard work and a belief that we can be up there with the big boys, we slowly built our reputation, opened a small shop, partnered with the best bike brand Santa Cruz Bicycles, expanded our shop, and now bringing over 30 brands of products for our riders and launching an online store soon.

Looking back, our story is no different from the Singapore Story. From being a small unknown kampong with a dream of a better life, through hard work and tenacity of our people, we have become a world class country right up there with the other big nations.

Therefore, we're proud to say that we are Singaporean this National Day, or any other day in fact.

P.S. We'll be closed this National Day weekend. Hope you guys have a good break and we'll see you again on Tuesday üòä

Wow, what a year it has been! Felt like just yesterday when we flew all the way to California to visit our Santa Cruz family at HQ earlier in May. Between that and having our friends @luca_shaw and @stevepeat come down to ride with us at #kentridgepark, a lot have happened indeed. 
For starters, many of you would have had a chat with Daniel, our new shop manager and also had a laugh with "Danny Trejo" Raffi (@mrraffi), our new mechanic. Together, we've built many new bikes and new friendships, also got to see some familiar faces we've not seen for a long time.

We've also opened a little online store this year, to help you guys shop better because we know our location can be a little "ulu" for some riders. And those eagle eyed ones will also notice we've got a new logo and branding as well, so that we keep up with the times üòé

But despite all these new stuff and changes, we're still that same ReEvolution that you guys know. And all we want to do is build the best bikes so that you can have fun riding. That said, we'll be putting down our tools at 4pm tomorrow and then it'll be 2020 when we see you again, 2 Jan 2020, 11.30am right on ü§üüèº Thank you all for being part of the ReEvo family üòâ

Now more than ever it‚Äôs important to get creative with your surroundings.

The Santa Cruz 5010 has always been the bike that turns obstacles into features but now with the fourth generation upon us, it expands on the concept of the little bike that has big ideas.

Fun-loving 27.5-inch wheels, 130mm of lower-link VPP travel paired with a 140mm fork and radically confident-inspiring geometry including, new for any Santa Cruz bicycle, size specific rear chainstay lengths.

It‚Äôs the kind of bike that makes any trail feel as familiar as the back of your hand.

If you want to truly fall in love... and have a fun relationship, in this generation there is one skill that we must master, the art of appreciating who you have, who you are, and remaining forever grateful for the energy and time that one person sacrifice for you.

Really happy to be back racing XCO again! Racing the Flabders XCO series in üáßüá™. Beautiful course, dry and dusty with good climbing. As expected, it was going to be full gas straight from the gun. Really happy to complete all 7 laps with decent timings having mini battles along the way, finishing 10mins behind the winner. No complaints for my results, 28th/44 in the Elite+au23 category. Solid stuff. On to the next! üî•üëäüèΩ

Proud to be Singaporean

Many of you guys might not know this, but ReEvolution actually started as a small operation out of Winson's apartment (back when he still had long hair!). Through sheer hard work and a belief that we can be up there with the big boys, we slowly built our reputation, opened a small shop, partnered with the best bike brand Santa Cruz Bicycles, expanded our shop, and now bringing over 30 brands of products for our riders and launching an online store soon.

Looking back, our story is no different from the Singapore Story. From being a small unknown kampong with a dream of a better life, through hard work and tenacity of our people, we have become a world class country right up there with the other big nations.

Therefore, we're proud to say that we are Singaporean this National Day, or any other day in fact.

P.S. We'll be closed this National Day weekend. Hope you guys have a good break and we'll see you again on Tuesday üòä

P.s. We are closed from 4pm today till Thu, 26 Dec 11am.
Wow, what a year it has been! Felt like just yesterday when we flew all the way to California to visit our Santa Cruz family at HQ earlier in May. Between that and having our friends @luca_shaw and @stevepeat come down to ride with us at #kentridgepark, a lot have happened indeed. 
For starters, many of you would have had a chat with Daniel, our new shop manager and also had a laugh with "Danny Trejo" Raffi (@mrraffi), our new mechanic. Together, we've built many new bikes and new friendships, also got to see some familiar faces we've not seen for a long time.

We've also opened a little online store this year, to help you guys shop better because we know our location can be a little "ulu" for some riders. And those eagle eyed ones will also notice we've got a new logo and branding as well, so that we keep up with the times üòé

But despite all these new stuff and changes, we're still that same ReEvolution that you guys know. And all we want to do is build the best bikes so that you can have fun riding. That said, we'll be putting down our tools at 4pm tomorrow and then it'll be 2020 when we see you again, 2 Jan 2020, 11.30am right on ü§üüèº Thank you all for being part of the ReEvo family üòâ

Now more than ever it‚Äôs important to get creative with your surroundings.
‚Ä¢
The Santa Cruz 5010 has always been the bike that turns obstacles into features but now with the fourth generation upon us, it expands on the concept of the little bike that has big ideas.
-
Fun-loving 27.5-inch wheels, 130mm of lower-link VPP travel paired with a 140mm fork and radically confident-inspiring geometry including, new for any Santa Cruz bicycle, size specific rear chainstay lengths.
-
It‚Äôs the kind of bike that makes any trail feel as familiar as the back of your hand.

Can't believe it's already nearing the end of this crazy year. As we look forward to the festive spirit and the new (hopefully better) year, we just want to thank you guys for supporting us through all the madness. 

We couldn't have made it without you; your patience in waiting through supply shortages, your confidence for choosing us to service your bikes, and your little snacks and coffee that you bring us to keep us motivated.

So from all of us here at Reevo, we wish that you have many presents at the bottom of your Christmas trees and most importantly, that you and your family be healthy and safe üòÅüòÅ

Also, here's some info on our opening times in the coming week:
24 Dec: 11.30am - 3pm
25 Dec: Christmas break
26 Dec: Back to work üõ†
31 Dec: 11.30am - 3pm
1 Jan: New Year's Day break
2 Jan: Back to work üõ†

If you want to truly fall in love... and have a fun relationship, in this generation there is one skill that we must master, the art of appreciating who you have, who you are, and remaining forever grateful for the energy and time that one person sacrifice for you.  Special thanks to: @dogmanchannel @alwinux  for the nice shots. #countmyblessingseveryday#countmyblessings#mountainbike#mtbsg#mtbphotography#mtblife#mtbchick#mtbgirl#santacruz#santacruzsyndicate#sydicate#dharco#leatt#leattfamily#ohlins#raceface#ridingconcept#mountainbiking#outdoorphotography#outdoors #reevolutionsg #santacruzbicyclessg #mtblifestyle
