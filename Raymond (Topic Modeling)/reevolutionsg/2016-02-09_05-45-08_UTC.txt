Santa Cruz Factory Racing hit up the iXS DH Cup round 2 at La Parva/Santiago Chile this weekend while warming up for the Santa Cruz Andes Pacifico Enduro which starts tomorrow, Feb 9th. 
Our man on the mountain @garyperkin got this shot of @scottchapinator aboard his #Bronson on the way to a 3rd in Masters. The kid @seanieb63 also took 3rd in U19 so we are sporting more bronze than a Rodin. Stay tuned for more updates from the #AndesPacifico this week!
