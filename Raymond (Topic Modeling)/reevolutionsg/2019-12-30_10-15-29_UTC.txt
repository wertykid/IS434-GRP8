Wow, what a year it has been! Felt like just yesterday when we flew all the way to California to visit our Santa Cruz family at HQ earlier in May. Between that and having our friends @luca_shaw and @stevepeat come down to ride with us at #kentridgepark, a lot have happened indeed. 
For starters, many of you would have had a chat with Daniel, our new shop manager and also had a laugh with "Danny Trejo" Raffi (@mrraffi), our new mechanic. Together, we've built many new bikes and new friendships, also got to see some familiar faces we've not seen for a long time.

We've also opened a little online store this year, to help you guys shop better because we know our location can be a little "ulu" for some riders. And those eagle eyed ones will also notice we've got a new logo and branding as well, so that we keep up with the times 😎

But despite all these new stuff and changes, we're still that same ReEvolution that you guys know. And all we want to do is build the best bikes so that you can have fun riding. That said, we'll be putting down our tools at 4pm tomorrow and then it'll be 2020 when we see you again, 2 Jan 2020, 11.30am right on 🤟🏼 Thank you all for being part of the ReEvo family 😉
