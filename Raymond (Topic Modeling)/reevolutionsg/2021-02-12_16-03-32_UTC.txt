Little Guilin

Notes to future self. Smoking kills, have killed my lungs, cut it down 🤷🏽 and ride more. Maybe, just maybe try to land the flip straight and not smack the side of my head before a race, airbags hit back hard. 😂🤦🏽‍♂️ Always good ⚡️times with the old homies and new homies. 🤟🏽📸 @aznsuperhero 🙏🏽 #mtb #ride
