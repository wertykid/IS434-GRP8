Proud to be Singaporean

Many of you guys might not know this, but ReEvolution actually started as a small operation out of Winson's apartment (back when he still had long hair!). Through sheer hard work and a belief that we can be up there with the big boys, we slowly built our reputation, opened a small shop, partnered with the best bike brand Santa Cruz Bicycles, expanded our shop, and now bringing over 30 brands of products for our riders and launching an online store soon.

Looking back, our story is no different from the Singapore Story. From being a small unknown kampong with a dream of a better life, through hard work and tenacity of our people, we have become a world class country right up there with the other big nations.

Therefore, we're proud to say that we are Singaporean this National Day, or any other day in fact.

P.S. We'll be closed this National Day weekend. Hope you guys have a good break and we'll see you again on Tuesday ðŸ˜Š
