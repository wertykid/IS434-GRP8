BRUTAL
Really happy to be back racing XCO again! Racing the Flabders XCO series in 🇧🇪. Beautiful course, dry and dusty with good climbing. As expected, it was going to be full gas straight from the gun. Really happy to complete all 7 laps with decent timings having mini battles along the way, finishing 10mins behind the winner. No complaints for my results, 28th/44 in the Elite+au23 category. Solid stuff. On to the next! 🔥👊🏽
