#SGBFF - It started over beers and banter between shoots, riddles about hosting a screening. A party where fella likeminded cycling enthusiasts will be hanging, beverage in one hand, fist bump around on the other. The aroma of pizza in the air. Everyone glued to the screen, music pumping, getting stoked watching locally produced bicycle videos.
