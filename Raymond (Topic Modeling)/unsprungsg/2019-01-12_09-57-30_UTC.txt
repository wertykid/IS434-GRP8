What sort of trails give you the mental blocks? Feel free to share below.  We follow the progress with Bobby as he gets himself into mountain biking with us.  #Repost @btonelli with @get_repost

The mental struggle was real. That was my big take away from my second mountain bike lesson.

Yes itâ€™s been a while since my first lesson, but was busy with work and the holidays so needed to pull my attention away for a minute.

Hope you enjoy this video series and let me know what you would like to see more of as I try to build up some decent MB skill over the coming months.

Once again big shoutout to @krempit and @unsprungsg for helping me learn some MB skillsðŸ˜Š
