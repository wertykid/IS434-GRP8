Trust’s linkage design creates more stability, which means more consistent handling, by increasing the trail as the fork goes through its travel. This results in a less twitchy vine feel when you’re doing things like braking hard, landing a jump or drop, or nosing into one of those roll-the-dice kinda chutes! Pushing hard in the trails has never been easier!
