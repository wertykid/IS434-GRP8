Still buzzing from the weekend, celebrating Nicky boy’s runner up award from nationals for U23 onboard his Wreckoning. It’s simply incredible to watch him grow from strength to strength. Off to the Elite ranks next year and we can’t wait for what he can pull off again! .
.
P.S. we’ll always remember what happened on your first overseas race. Hint: hanging on for dear life. Congratulations buddy!
