The SB150 runs Yeti’s exciting progressive race geometry! That means longer reach, steeper seat angle, and a slacker head angle combine with a shorter fork offset. Why compensate on climbing or descending performance when you can have both!
.
Yeti’s Carbon Series runs the same awesome geometry and life time warranty as the renowned Turq series bikes! Just at a more affordable price 😉🤘🏼
