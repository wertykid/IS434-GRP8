The Offering, our new FULLY OPTIMIZED 140mm rear travel 29” mountain bike with a steeper 77° seat angle, metric trunnion-mounted rear shock, and enough tire clearance to run 2.6” rubber. Taking the best attributes from both the Following MB and the Wreckoning LB, while developing its own character, the Offering provides a new experience with longer reach while creating a bike that has all the same pop with an increase in stability without sacrificing corner destroying performance.
