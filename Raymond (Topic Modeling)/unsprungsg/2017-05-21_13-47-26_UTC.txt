We are truly stoked to be part of the Singapore Open Enduro this year! Thanks @wilson.low.raw for giving us a great opportunity to support and give back to the women's MTB community! Today we applaud these fine women for their grit and tenacity to compete at Singapore's finest level. A big congratulations to the podium winners of the Women's Open - Kusma, Ting and Tsal! . .
