Evil brings shred to gravel! Bringing crazy numbers to the gravel game in good Evil fashion, Long, low and slack, with massive tire clearance up to 700c x 50mm! Rear axle spacing is kept to 142 x 12mm with 430mm chainstays, and the 68mm threaded bottom bracket shell keeps things simple. Rumour has it, the Hagar is gonna give birth to a new breed of gravel riders!
