We’ve tried many and often find ourselves going back to these two platform pedals; our thoughts below. Which is your favorite flat pedal? .
.
Deity TMAC: Massive stability and grip from it’s generous platform and deep concavity. Pair with Five Ten and they feel like you’re clipped in. Perfect for Downhill, Enduro and anyone seeking a solid platform.
.
Burgtec Penthouse: Balance between grip and float, great for rotating your feet. Made in the UK and available with a Ti spindle, it’s light af without sacrificing durability. Perfect for Trails, weight watchers and anyone seeking a bombproof pedal.
