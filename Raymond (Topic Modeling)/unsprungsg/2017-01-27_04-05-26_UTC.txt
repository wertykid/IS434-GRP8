A massive congratulations to Sylvia, our very own PMBI Level 1 MTB Coach at Unsprung! We are so proud of you! Only lady in the intensive course conducted by Coach Rhys Ellis, with 18+ hrs of riding, guiding and teaching practice, and totally owned it. 
Coach Rhys lives in Whistler, with 10 years of coaching experience under his belt. Rhys is currently the Race Program Director and Head Coach of the ZEP Racing Team and Mountain bike camps back home! 
It just got more exciting for us and we will likely see her in action, delivering structured MTB skills lessons with the internationally-recognized PMBI teaching methodology. .
