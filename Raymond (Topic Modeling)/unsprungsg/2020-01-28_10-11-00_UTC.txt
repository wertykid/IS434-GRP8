Mischief makers at Evil has done it again! This time, redefining the boundaries of Gravel. The Chamois Hagarâ€™s 66.67Â° head angle and shorter offset give it more trail(93mm), which means more stability. For the dudes good with numbers, youâ€™ll know how much that is! More stability might be an under statement. Oh, it also comes ready for a dropper post ðŸ˜‰
